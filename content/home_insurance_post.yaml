    body: "<h2 id=\"whatiscoverageadwellinginsurance\">What Is Coverage A – Dwelling Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Also known as main structure coverage, dwelling coverage is the part of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> that pays to repair or rebuild your home’s physical structure (think: walls, floors, roof, windows, support beams, and foundation) when a covered incident damages it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesdwellinginsurancecover\">What Does Dwelling Insurance Cover?</h2>\n<p>Standard <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3</a> dwelling coverage typically covers all sources of damage to the home except those the policy lists as exclusions. That means it can cover most common events, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire or smoke</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">Hurricane</a></li>\n<li>Hail</li>\n<li>Lightning</li>\n<li>Explosion</li>\n<li>Water damage caused by burst pipes or overflowed household appliances</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Vandalism</li>\n<li>Falling objects</li>\n<li>Weight of ice, snow, or sleet</li>\n<li>Impact by aircraft or land vehicle</li>\n<li>Riots</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Different <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> may have different limits (the dollar amount of coverage available), so read your policy! If you have questions about what your dwelling coverage can and can't do, just give us a call.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdwellinginsurancedoesntcover\">What Dwelling Insurance Doesn't Cover</h2>\n<p>Remember how we mentioned some events are excluded from coverage? Most of the time, dwelling insurance doesn't cover damaged caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Earthquakes / earth movement</li>\n<li><a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">Floods</a></li>\n<li>General wear and tear</li>\n<li>Lack of regular and proper maintenance</li>\n<li>Infestations</li>\n<li>War and/or nuclear hazards</li>\n<li>Intentional loss</li>\n<li>Smog, rust, corrosion, and rot</li>\n<li>Settling, expansion, shrinking, or bulging</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some cases, like floods and earthquakes, you can simply add on flood or earthquake coverage to address the risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notalldwellinginsuranceisequal\">Not All Dwelling Insurance Is Equal</h2>\n<p>If you make a claim for damage to your home itself, the type of payout you'll receive depends on whether you have <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value coverage</a> or <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost coverage</a>.</p>\n<p>Actual cash value coverage is typically cheaper, but it can also leave you high and dry when you need to repair your home. By contrast, replacement cost dwelling coverage pays out what it costs to rebuild your home and replace its elements at the current market rate.</p>\n<p>Here's a better look at each type of coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"actualcashvaluedwellingcoverage\">Actual Cash Value Dwelling Coverage</h3>\n<p>This type of coverage takes depreciation into account when calculating your payout. While depreciation calculations may vary from insurer to insurer, a common method is to estimate the lifespan of the home's components and subtract a certain percentage for each year since the purchase.</p>\n<p>Take your roof, for example. Let's say it has a 15-year lifespan and it's 12 years old when you file a claim for its repair. If it's $10,000 for a new roof, an insurer may use this formula to figure out the payout for your claim:</p>\n<p><strong>R × (E - C) / E = ACV</strong></p>\n<p><strong>R = replacement cost of the item</strong><br />\n<strong>E = expected life (lifespan) of the item</strong><br />\n<strong>C = current life of the item</strong><br />\n<strong>ACV = actual cash value</strong></p>\n<p>Not a math person? Here's what it comes to:</p>\n<p>$10,000 x (15-12) / 15 = $2,000</p>\n<p>The short answer is you will be paying the majority of the cost for that new roof if you have ACV coverage. With this calculation, your payout would be a mere $2,000.</p>\n<p>You end up saving some money with this option, but the payouts may pale in comparison to what you need to actually repair your home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"replacementcostdwellingcoverage\">Replacement Cost Dwelling Coverage</h3>\n<p>This type of coverage can cover the cost to replace or rebuild your home with materials of similar kind and quality. So if you need to make a claim, you get the payout you need to repair or rebuild your home to its former glory.</p>\n<p>To estimate your home's replacement cost, you multiply the building cost per square foot in your area by your home’s square footage. You'd also need to factor in other costs, such as flooring, fixtures and appliances, your roof, and exterior features.</p>\n<p>If that sounds like a lot of legwork, don't sweat it. We can calculate your home's replacement cost for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchmainstructureinsurancedoineed\">How Much Main Structure Insurance Do I Need?</h2>\n<p>The amount of dwelling coverage you need depends on the cost to rebuild your home (including labor and materials) if the house is completely destroyed by a covered event. Our application automatically calculates and recommends the replacement cost for you, though you can adjust this amount.</p>\n<p>Just remember not to underinsure your home. Your insurance is only worthwhile if you can depend on it in times of upheaval.</p>\n<p>To get started, give us a call at <a href=\"tel:855-717-0022\">855-717-0022</a>, or <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">get a quote here</a>.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"otherstructuresinsurance\">Other Structures Insurance</h2>\n<p>Other structures insurance, also known as Coverage B, is the part of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a> that protects structures on your property other than your house. That includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fences</li>\n<li>Sheds</li>\n<li>Detached garages</li>\n<li>Greenhouses</li>\n<li>Driveways</li>\n<li>Guest cottages</li>\n<li>Gazebos</li>\n<li>Barns</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesotherstructuresinsurancecover\">What Does Other Structures Insurance Cover?</h2>\n<p>Other structures are protected against the same risks as your home, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Wind / hail</li>\n<li>Vandalism</li>\n<li>And more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, Kin's policies offer open-perils coverage for your home and other structures. That means incidents that aren't explicitly excluded in the policy are covered. That's a lot of incidents (and protection!), so we didn't list them all here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcoveragebdoesntcover\">What Coverage B Doesn't Cover</h2>\n<p>While your Coverage B can offer a lot of protection for other structures on your property, it has some limits. For example, this portion of your policy can't cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The contents in your other structures, such as garden equipment, sporting equipment, pool supplies, etc. These are typically covered by your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property coverage</a>.</li>\n<li>Any detached structures that you use for business purposes.</li>\n<li>Farming or ranching activities or animals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other structures coverage excludes the same perils as your dwelling insurance. So, for example, it won't cover wear and tear, earth movements, infestations, or flood damage. For flood protection, you need <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchcoveragebshouldihave\">How Much Coverage B Should I Have?</h2>\n<p>Other structures coverage is usually automatically calculated as 10 percent of the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">main structure</a>. In other words, if your house is insured for $200,000, you'll typically have $20,000 in protection for your garage, fence, etc.</p>\n<p>You can adjust this amount to more than 10 percent if you need extra protection. However, most experts recommend you carry at least 10 percent in Coverage B to protect your structures – they can be more expensive to repair or replace after a disaster than you might think.</p>\n<p>It's also worth noting that every insurer handles <a href=\"/blog/swimming-pool-insurance-requirements/\">pool coverage</a> differently. However, if your pool is in-ground, it likely falls under the protection of Coverage B. Ask your insurer to be sure, and also ask if special limits apply.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatispersonalpropertyinsurance\">What Is Personal Property Insurance?</h2>\n<p>The personal property portion of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, also called Coverage C, protects your possessions—the belongings that make your house a home. That includes things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Furniture.</li>\n<li>Clothing.</li>\n<li>Electronics (think: TV, laptops, cameras, etc.).</li>\n<li>Jewelry.</li>\n<li>Recreational gear.</li>\n<li>And more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your homeowners policy’s personal property protection insures these items for their <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatpersonalpropertyinsurancecovers\">What Personal Property Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p>Typically, Coverage C offers protection when your items are lost or damaged. The most common covered <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> that cause loss to personal belongings are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Vandalism</li>\n<li>Windstorms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you opt for a special personal property <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a>, you can get protection for damage caused by events beyond the ones listed here. It’s also worth noting that items included in a special personal property endorsement may be covered on a <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement-cost basis</a>. This means your <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a> covers what it costs to repair or replace your belongings with new, similar items (not including your <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a>) rather than only paying out what the depreciated item is worth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatpersonalpropertyinsurancedoesntcover\">What Personal Property Insurance Doesn't Cover</h2>\n<p>Certain possessions are often excluded from personal property coverage, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vehicles</li>\n<li>Credit cards</li>\n<li>Animals</li>\n<li>Aircraft and parts</li>\n<li>Business data</li>\n<li>Personal property you are renting to others</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Coverage C also doesn’t usually pay to repair or replace items damaged by storm surges and flood waters, either. For that, you’d need <a href=\"/home-insurance/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"doescoverageccoverlostitems\">Does Coverage C Cover Lost Items?</h3>\n<p>Most homeowners and condo insurance policies don't cover lost or misplaced items. What they do cover, however, are financial losses caused by certain perils.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say something is stolen from your house, like your television. Theft is covered by most home insurance for personal property policies, so that loss is most likely covered. But your home insurance policy usually doesn’t cover a loss if you simply misplace an item. If you misplace your valuables or leave them behind at a hotel, then you’re probably going to pay for that loss on your own.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchcoveragecdoyouneed\">How Much Coverage C Do You Need?</h2>\n<p>It takes years to fill your home with things you love, so it’s important to have adequate coverage for these belongings. You can use your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling insurance</a> as a benchmark for how much property coverage to buy.</p>\n<p>For example, many homeowners opt to carry about 20 to 50 percent of their dwelling insurance for their belongings. So if your home is insured for $200,000, you’d likely want $40,000 to $100,000 in personal property coverage. If you have a lot of belongings, that percentage / amount of coverage may need to be higher.</p>\n<p>If you have really valuable belongings, like fine jewelry, art, furs, coin collections, wine collection, or antiques, you may want to look into <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduling these items</a>. Scheduling your property allows you to protect these items for the amount they’re worth without drastically increasing your overall premium. There also isn’t a deductible with scheduled personal property coverage. Nice little bonus, right?</p>\n<p>Give us a call at (855) 717-0022 if you want help scheduling your property today.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howhomeinventoriesboostyourpropertyprotection\">How Home Inventories Boost Your Property Protection</h2>\n<p>To figure out how much your belongings are worth, walk around your home and document the items that you invested in.

In most cases, the answer is yes.</p>\n<p>While personal belongings insurance isn’t usually required, it’s important to have so you know you can recover if you experience a loss. Luckily, personal property insurance is a standard part of homeowners policies.</p>\n<p>Because this is a type of insurance that pays for damages to belongings, people in the industry sometimes call it content insurance – basically, it covers most of the things inside your home, from gadgets to precious family heirlooms. But remember, you don’t have to buy separate homeowners insurance for personal property coverage. If you have a home insurance policy, you likely already have personal property insurance.</p>\n<p>Want to spend less money when you purchase a homeowners insurance policy? Get a quote from us. Our customers often find that our homeowners policy with personal property insurance often saves them money while still providing quality protection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoespersonalpropertycoveragecost\">How Much Does Personal Property Coverage Cost?</h2>\n<p>Coverage C is part of your homeowners policy, so it’s difficult to separate out how much of your premium goes towards personal property coverage and how much goes to your other coverages. That said, there are several <a href=\"/blog/11-factors-impacting-home-insurance-premium/\">factors that impact your premium</a>, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>The value of your belongings.</strong> For Coverage C, this is probably the most important factor. A home inventory can give you a pretty good idea what your personal property is worth.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Your risk.</strong> Different homes face different perils, and that has a big impact on how much your home insurance premium. For example, a home on a coast or in <a href=\"/blog/is-tornado-alley-shifting/\">Tornado Alley</a> has a greater chance of wind damage, so insuring it costs more.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Your home’s characteristics.</strong> Size, age, and even construction type can all play a role in your insurance policy premium.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Details about your homeowners policy can also impact your costs. For example, you’ll want to know if you have <a href=\"/blog/replacement-cost-vs-acv/\">replacement cost vs actual cash value coverage</a>. Most homeowners policies cover your personal property for its actual cash value, which subtracts for depreciation if your belongings are ruined in a covered incident. However, you can often opt for replacement cost coverage. This type of policy uses the current market price of your belongings without deducting depreciation.</p>\n<p>Personal property replacement cost policies are typically a bit more expensive than actual cash value coverage but may be worth it if you want to replace your damaged items with ones of a similar quality. Getting replacement coverage usually means you won’t be caught off guard if you make a claim only to discover your losses aren’t covered to the extent you thought they’d be. On the other hand, you might prefer to save money by opting for an actual cash value policy.</p>\n<p>The great news is that we offer actual cash value personal property insurance, but you can ask for replacement cost coverage. Either way, our representatives will take the time to explain what you’re getting in your homeowners policy. No unwelcome surprises!</p>\n<p>Most home insurance providers (us included!) require you to carry a minimum amount of personal property coverage – usually around 10% of your dwelling coverage. This means a home that costs $300,000 to rebuild, typically needs a minimum of $30,000 in personal property coverage. But again – that’s just a minimum. We usually suggest getting personal property coverage that’s at least 20% of your dwelling insurance.</p>\n<p>But the key is figuring out what you can afford and how much risk you’re willing to tolerate. Every Kin policy is tailored to the individual to ensure they only pay for the protection they need.</p>\n<p>Not sure what that is? That’s okay.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatispersonalliabilityinsurance\">What Is Personal Liability Insurance?</h2>\n<p>No matter how cautious you are, accidents happen and can be very costly. Personal liability insurance is the part of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a> that steps in when someone makes a claim or sues you over bodily harm or property loss you caused. It can help pay for things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The injured party's medical bills.</li>\n<li>Repair costs for the person's damaged property.</li>\n<li>Your legal expenses if the claim escalates into a lawsuit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So say, for example, your neighbor stops by to bring your mail that got delivered to their house. Let's also imagine you've been meaning to repair the rail next to your porch steps – it's been a little wobbly lately. Unfortunately, that wobbly rail gave out while your neighbor held it to climb the steps, and they end up in the hospital after badly hurting their neck and back. They want you to pay $300,000 in damages accrued from missed work, surgery, and follow-up doctor visits.</p>\n<p>If you didn't have personal liability insurance to cover this massive cost, you might have to sell your house (and other assets) to settle the debt. But if you have at least $300,000 in personal liability insurance, you can make things right with your neighbor and not sell your property or deplete your savings.</p>\n<p>Think it won't happen to you? Consider this: according the <a href=\"https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/home-and-community/home-and-community-overview/introduction/\">National Safety Council (NSC)</a>, 38,300,000 people suffered nonfatal medically consulted injuries in homes in 2017.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoespersonalliabilityinsurancecover\">What Does Personal Liability Insurance Cover?</h2>\n<p>Coverage E can help pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Repairs and legal expenses if you accidentally damage someone's property</li>\n<li>Medical bills and legal expenses if someone is accidentally injured on your property</li>\n<li>Medical bills and legal expenses if you are liable for the accidental injury of someone at another location</li>\n<li>An injured party’s loss of wages</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatpersonalliabilityinsurancedoesntcover\">What Personal Liability Insurance Doesn't Cover</h2>\n<p>Your personal liability coverage won't help pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intentional damage to someone's property</li>\n<li>Injuries you purposefully cause</li>\n<li>Damage to your own property or residents' property</li>\n<li>Your injuries or injuries of residents in the home</li>\n<li>Claims arising from your business or profession</li>\n<li>Auto damage or injuries that happen in an auto accident</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's also worth noting that your personal liability coverage won't address dog bite claims unless you add an <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">animal liability endorsement</a> to your policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchpersonalliabilityinsurancedoineed\">How Much Personal Liability Insurance Do I Need?</h2>\n<p>The amount of personal liability coverage depends on a few factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your home's characteristics (e.g., if you have a pool, you likely need more liability protection because it increases the chance of someone getting hurt at your home)</li>\n<li>Your assets (if you have a high-value home, you may need more coverage)</li>\n<li>Your lifestyle (more visitors mean more opportunities for someone to get hurt)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Typically, homeowners insurance policies offer $100,000 in personal liability coverage at minimum. But because bodily injury liabilities are so expensive, it's often smart to at least have the value of your home in liability protection. That's because if someone is injured and sues for medical costs and additional expenses, like emotional damage, their lawyer may use your home's value as a basis for what they can reasonably expect to win from you in a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>Some insurance providers offer a maximum liability coverage amount (ours is $500,000 in Florida, for example). Oftentimes, increasing your liability protection has little impact on your total premium.</p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"/faq/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need/\">how much homeowners insurance you need</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendoineedpersonalliabilitycoverage\">When Do I Need Personal Liability Coverage?</h2>\n<p>As a homeowner, your house is a major asset. It may be the biggest purchase you make your whole life.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatiscoveragefmedicalpaymentscoverage\">What Is Coverage F, Medical Payments Coverage?</h2>\n<p>Medical payments coverage, part of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>, can help pay for small injuries that happen to your guests on your property, regardless of who is at fault. This portion of your policy is designed to resolve smaller claims so they don't escalate into lawsuits.</p>\n<p>Medical payments coverage has low limits, typically between $1,000 and $5,000, which is usually enough to amend a situation that calls for immediate medical attention.</p>\n<p>So say, for example, your neighbor stops by to bring you some holiday cookies. Real nice guy, that one. Unfortunately, he trips over the Christmas decor on your porch, falls down the steps, and breaks an ankle. Yikes!</p>\n<p>Your medical payments coverage can step in so you don't have to empty your savings account to pay for your neighbor's medical bills. It can help cover the ambulance ride, his X-ray, and the cost of treatment, up to the limits of your policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesmedicalpaymentscoveragecover\">What Does Medical Payments Coverage Cover?</h2>\n<p>Medical payments insurance can typically cover expenses sustained in order to resolve a medical emergency, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Immediate medical attention</li>\n<li>Surgery</li>\n<li>X-rays</li>\n<li>Dental services</li>\n<li>Ambulance rides</li>\n<li>Hospital stays</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatmedicalpaymentscoveragedoesntcover\">What Medical Payments Coverage Doesn't Cover</h2>\n<p>Medical payments coverage can't pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bodily injuries to residents of your home</li>\n<li>Property damage</li>\n<li>Pain or suffering</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whyyouneedmedicalpaymentscoverage\">Why You Need Medical Payments Coverage</h2>\n<p>Medical payments coverage usually deters an injured third party from pursuing an expensive liability claim over a relatively small and straightforward expense.

If you’re wondering, “how much is house insurance?” it’s important to recognize that your policy is an investment in your financial well-being. Protecting your home and belongings is a way of protecting yourself and your family.</p>\n<p>But we get it – no one is trying to spend more on coverage than they have to, which is why it’s vital to find competitive homeowners insurance rates that provide owners renters with general protection from additional expenses that pop up when you need to repair damage to your home.</p>\n<p>The national average annual cost of home insurance is $1,279 per year, and home insurance prices are trending upward – likely due to inflation and an increase in extreme weather.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averagecostofhomeownersinsurancethroughtheyears\">Average Cost of Homeowners Insurance Through the Years</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Year</th>\n<th>Average Home Insurance Premium</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2009</td>\n<td>$880</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2010</td>\n<td>$909</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2011</td>\n<td>$979</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2012</td>\n<td>$1,034</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2013</td>\n<td>$1,096</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2014</td>\n<td>$1,132</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2015</td>\n<td>$1,173</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2016</td>\n<td>$1,192</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2017</td>\n<td>$1,211</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2018</td>\n<td>$1,249</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2019</td>\n<td>$1,279</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>Source: The Insurance Information Institute,</em> <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-homeowners-and-renters-insurance\"><em>Facts + Statistics: Homeowners and Renters Insurance</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p>That said, your individual costs for insurance coverage depend on several potential factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where you live and your region’s weather-related risks</li>\n<li>The amount of coverage you carry (the higher your limits, the pricier the policy)</li>\n<li>The characteristics of your home (replacement cost, roof type, age, construction, etc.)</li>\n<li>Your deductible</li>\n<li>Your background (your insurance score, claims history, and available discounts)</li>\n<li>And more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These typical homeowners insurance variables mean that the average price of homeowners insurance fluctuates – a lot.</p>\n<p>That’s why answering questions like, “What is a good price for home insurance?” isn’t always straightforward.

While some <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> are universal – a home can get broken into anywhere – others are regionally specific. For example, a home along the coast of Florida is uniquely exposed to hurricanes, while a home in Oklahoma may be at risk for <a href=\"/blog/tornado-alley-hurricane-alley-insurance/\">tornadoes</a> and earthquakes. Many California homes face serious risk of <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire</a>, while homes in Louisiana may face flooding and hurricanes.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the coin, landlocked homes in the Midwest and West – Utah, Wisconsin, Idaho, and Nevada – often have lower home insurance rates because they are exposed to fewer catastrophes like <a href=\"/home-insurance/flood-insurance/\">floods</a>, hurricanes, wildfires, and earthquakes. This means they are less likely to suffer damage and require repairs.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that where you get your home insurance can seriously impact how much you pay for coverage. For example, while the national average premium for <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> is $1,988, Kin’s Florida customers pay an average of $1,354 yearly. Your city may influence your rates, too. For example, these are the yearly median premiums Kin customers pay in the following Florida cities, based on our data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/jacksonville/\">Jacksonville</a>: $1,191</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/miami/\">Miami</a>: $3,033</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/orlando/\">Orlando</a>: $1,265</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/tampa/\">Tampa</a>: $2,107</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With that in mind, let’s look at the highest and lowest home insurance costs by state.</p>\n<h3 id=\"top5mostexpensivestatesforhomeinsurance\">Top 5 Most Expensive States for Home Insurance</h3>\n<p>The following states have the highest average home insurance premiums:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Louisiana: $2,037</li>\n<li>Oklahoma: $2,000</li>\n<li>Florida: $1,988</li>\n<li>Texas: $1,982</li>\n<li>Rhode Island: $1,731</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"top5leastexpensivestatesforhomeinsurance\">Top 5 Least Expensive States for Home Insurance</h3>\n<p>The following states have the lowest average home insurance premiums:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Oregon: $727</li>\n<li>Utah: $743</li>\n<li>Wisconsin: $750</li>\n<li>Nevada: $791</li>\n<li>Idaho: $799</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"homeownersinsurancecostbycoveragelimits\">Homeowners Insurance Cost by Coverage Limits</h2>\n<p>Now’s a good time to remind you that the coverage amount you choose impacts your home insurance premium, too. The averages listed below are based on <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policies</a> that offer open-perils coverage for the dwelling and named perils coverage for personal property – that’s pretty standard for a home insurance policy. If you opt for all-perils coverage for your belongings, too, that will increase the cost of your policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nationalaveragepremiumsbycoveragelimits\">National Average Premiums by Coverage Limits</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Coverage Limits</th>\n<th>Average Premium</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$100,000 - $124,999</td>\n<td>$882</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$150,000 - $174,999</td>\n<td>$975</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$200,000 - $299,999</td>\n<td>$1,113</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Similarly, your policy limits – or the amount of coverage you have – for your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling</a> impacts your costs. If you look at national averages for home insurance costs based on coverage levels, you can get an idea of how your choices may increase or reduce your rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howyourhomescharacteristicsimpactthecostofhomeinsurance\">How Your Home’s Characteristics Impact the Cost of Home Insurance</h2>\n<p>If your home’s replacement cost – that is, how much it would cost to rebuild it from the ground up – is high, your premium will be higher, too. As illustrated above, the amount of dwelling coverage you have can impact your rates considerably.</p>\n<p>For homeowners in Florida, the home’s <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">roof shape</a> and wind mitigation measures can be a significant cost factor, too. Hip-shaped roofs tend to weather hurricane winds better, so they may fetch a lower rate. A homeowner who has invested in other <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">wind mitigation measures</a>, like stronger roof-to-wall connections, roof-to-deck connections, and roofing materials, can lower their rates even more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeownersinsurancecostfactorsthatcanbecontrolled\">Homeowners Insurance Cost Factors That Can Be Controlled</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cost Factors You Can Control</th>\n<th>Cost Factors That Are Mostly Fixed</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Coverage Types and Amounts</td>\n<td>Location</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deductibles</td>\n<td>Claims History</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Risk Mitigation Discounts</td>\n<td>Home Age and Replacement Cost</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 id=\"costfactorsyoucancontrol\">Cost Factors You Can Control</h3>\n<p>The following factors impact your home insurance costs, but you can tinker with them to make your policy more affordable:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Your coverage types and amounts</strong>. The more coverage you have, the more your policy will cost. That’s why it’s smart to comparison shop and weigh the amount of coverage against the cost of coverage. Ideally, you will look for a policy that offers the maximum amount of coverage at the most affordable price.</li>\n<li><strong>Your deductibles.</strong> Typically, the higher your <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a> amount, the lower your premium. That’s because when you accept a higher deductible, your insurer will simply have to pay out less for a claim.</li>\n<li><strong>Your</strong> <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\"><strong>homeowners insurance discounts</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Ask your insurer about every discount you may qualify for. With Kin, homeowners may be eligible for wind mitigation discounts, claims-free discounts, fire and security alarm discounts, and more depending on their state.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"costfactorsthatarelargelyoutofyourhands\">Cost Factors That Are Largely Out of Your Hands</h3>\n<p>The following variables are often fixed but have a significant impact on your home insurance rates:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Where you live.</strong> Your location has the biggest impact on your premium. Chances are you’ll pay a higher rate if your home is in an area prone to catastrophes like hurricanes and wildfires. If your home is remote and <a href=\"/glossary/protection-class/\">far from fire stations</a> and emergency services, your rate may be higher. And if you’re in an area with a high <a href=\"/blog/4-safest-cities-in-america/\">rate of property crimes</a>, that can drive up your cost, too.</li>\n<li><strong>Claims history.</strong> While you can contest your claims record in certain situations and not all types of claims have the same impact on your rates, a checkered claims history will increase your premium.

Comparison Shop</h3>\n<p>Don’t go with the first insurance provider you find or the one your parents use. The best way to make sure you get a good deal on your coverage is to shop around. Get a quote from a few different providers, and don’t look at price alone. You’ll also want to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The reputation of the company.</strong> Check out their <a href=\"/reviews/\">online reviews</a> to get a glimpse into the customer experience you can expect.</li>\n<li><strong>The amount and type of coverage offered.</strong> You might save a few dollars with an actual-cash value policy, but you will sacrifice coverage. It’s wise to only consider policies that offer replacement-cost coverage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2gettherightamountofcoverage\">2. Get the Right Amount of Coverage</h3>\n<p>When you find an insurance provider you trust, this part should be easy. A good insurance provider will help you choose the appropriate amount of coverage for your home, your belongings, and your liability. Not too much coverage, which can drive up your premiums, and not too little, which leaves you inadequately protected.</p>\n<p>Ideally, your policy will offer replacement cost coverage for both your home (which means you can rebuild with similar materials at the current market rate) and your belongings (which allows you to replace your missing or damaged possessions with similar, new items).</p>\n<h3 id=\"3rethinkyourdeductible\">3. Rethink Your Deductible</h3>\n<p>Typically, the higher your deductible, the lower your premium will be. While it may be tempting to choose the highest possible deductible to offset your monthly bill, be careful. You don’t want to choose such a high deductible that it puts an unreasonable financial burden on you when you need to make a claim.</p>\n<p>For reference, Kin customers can choose between the following deductible options: $500, $1,000, $2,500, $5,000 or 1, 2, 3, or 5 percent of your dwelling coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4avoidriskyinvestmentsifyoucan\">4. Avoid Risky Investments, If You Can</h3>\n<p>While you can’t pick up your home and move it to a new location, you can opt out of adding things to your home that may raise your premium. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Swimming pools</strong> usually raise the cost of your coverage because they increase your liability exposure.</li>\n<li><strong>Trampolines</strong>, while fun, are injuries waiting to happen. Trampolines raise your risk of visitor injuries and so increase your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">liability coverage</a> needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"5makeyourhomesafer\">5. Make Your Home Safer</h3>\n<p>Certain updates to your house not only make the home safer, but they can also cut your home insurance costs. For example, the following improvements may reduce your bill:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/when-to-replace-your-roof/\"><strong>Fix your roof</strong></a><strong>.</strong> A new roof can substantially cut down on your insurance costs. Some areas may see savings up to 10 percent.</li>\n<li><strong>Mitigate wind risk.</strong> This is a big money saver if you live in hurricane-prone areas. In fact, in Florida, insurance providers are legally required to offer discounts for wind-resistant homes. Consider investing in stronger roof-to-deck and roof-to-wall attachments, storm shutters, fortified garage doors, and shatter-proof windows.</li>\n<li><strong>Upgrade your HVAC, electrical, and plumbing systems.</strong> Newer systems often fetch a substantial discount.</li>\n<li><strong>Get a generator.</strong> Some insurers offer a discount for homes that have a backup generator.</li>\n<li><strong>Invest in a centrally monitored security system.</strong> Depending on where you live, you can get a 5 to 7.5 percent discount on your insurance from Kin when you have proof of a centrally monitored security system.</li>\n<li><strong>Install an automatic water shut off.</strong> Kin offers customers a discount when they have a system that automatically shuts off the water supply when a leak is detected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before making big investments, talk to your insurance agent to see what kind of discounts you can expect from each improvement. That can help you spend money that will be offset by savings down the road.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6boostyourcreditscore\">6. Boost Your Credit Score</h3>\n<p>Most insurers can use your <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-score-explained/\">insurance score</a>, which is based on your credit score, as a factor to determine your premium. The logic is the better your score, the less likely you are to make a claim (and subsequently, you qualify for lower rates).</p>\n<p>To improve your credit score and reduce your insurance bill, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay your bills on time.</li>\n<li>Don’t carry a balance from month to month.</li>\n<li>Don’t use more than 30 percent of your credit limit.</li>\n<li>Don’t take out more lines of credit than you need.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"7reviewyourpolicywhenyourenew\">7. Review Your Policy When You Renew</h3>\n<p>We get the impulse to buy and forget about your coverage, but a yearly review is a good practice for a few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You want to make sure your coverage still reflects the reality of your living situation.</strong> If you remodeled or bought some valuable new belongings, you want to make sure your policy still offers adequate protection.</li>\n<li><strong>You get to see if you qualify for more discounts.</strong> If you made security updates or upgraded your home’s systems, you may be eligible for lower rates.</li>\n<li><strong>You want the chance to get rid of coverage you no longer need.</strong> Got rid of that <a href=\"/blog/is-your-homeowners-policy-ready-for-summer/\">trampoline</a>? Great! Before you renew your coverage, let your agent know about possessions you no longer need to protect and liabilities you no longer need to address.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"8askyourinsurancecompanyforprotips\">8. Ask Your Insurance Company for Pro Tips</h3>\n<p>Every insurance company offers different discounts, prices, and coverage. Luckily, they also typically offer assistance to help you figure these out. So while the tips here apply to most insurers, you’ll get the best insight from a provider who can give you the scoop on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Safety and risk mitigation discounts</li>\n<li>Electronic policy discounts</li>\n<li>Claims-free discounts</li>\n</ul>"

    body: "<p>If you’ve just bought your first investment property, you’ll need to update your insurance coverage, no matter whether your rental is short term or long term.</p>\n<p>While some insurance companies allow homeowners to extend their home insurance to a short-term rental, this is not an appropriate solution for most rental situations. Unless you’re living on-site and seldom rent your extra unit, this probably doesn’t apply to you.</p>\n<p>If you’re primarily dealing with long-term rental properties, you’ll need landlord insurance (usually provided through a <a href=\"/glossary/dp3-policy/\">DP3 policy</a>).</p>\n<p>But before we get any further, let's take a look at the difference between landlord insurance and home insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"landlordinsurancevshomeownersinsurancevs\">Landlord Insurance vs. Homeowners Insurance {#vs}</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance primarily covers three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The house where you live (called a “dwelling” in insurance parlance) and other structures on the property</li>\n<li>The things in your house</li>\n<li>Your liability related to the property</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Homeowners insurance</a> is usually the go-to choice for your primary residence, that place you occupy 100 percent of the time. However, it does not cover commercial risk, which is why landlord insurance is so essential.</p>\n<p>Landlord insurance is necessary to cover the business side of renting out your property. Maybe you have one rental property that you use to generate income on the side. This may not <em>feel</em> like a business – maybe it’s just one investment property – but in the eyes of the IRS and your insurance company, it most certainly is.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatislandlordinsurancewhat\">What Is Landlord Insurance? {#what}</h2>\n<p>Landlord policies cover a number of things, usually including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Property</strong>: This includes the dwelling, other structures, and any personal property used to service the rental that you leave onsite (think of your snowblower and lawn mower).</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/fair-rental-value/\"><strong>Fair rental value</strong></a>: Sometimes called “fair rental income,” this is the part of your landlord insurance that covers the most important part of the business aspect of your property: the rental income. In the event that a covered event makes the property temporarily unfit for occupation, this may help you maintain your income stream.</li>\n<li><strong>Unoccupied space</strong>: You’d think an unoccupied property would be less trouble than one full of tenants sliding their chairs across your refinished hardwood floors, but that’s not necessarily the case. An empty space can suffer water damage or a rodent infestation or worse with no one around to report the events. The litany of possible issues is far from reassuring, so we won’t dig deeper here, but it does behoove you to treat your investment property like a valuable asset even when it’s not actively pulling in rental income.</li>\n<li><strong>Liability</strong>: This may help you cover legal expenses or medical bills if someone is injured on your property. This is one of the biggest areas for concern, as liability claims can be much more expensive than property claims, which is why it’s one of the greatest incentives for ensuring you have the right coverage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What’s not covered</strong>: Maintenance costs and tenants’ belongings. Unlike regular homeowners insurance, the contents of rented spaces are not covered by this policy. Tenants should take out their own <a href=\"/glossary/ho4-policy/\">renters insurance policies</a> to ensure their valuables are covered.</p>\n<p><strong>Sidebar:</strong> <a href=\"/blog/airbnb-home-insurance/\">Airbnbs have some special insurance considerations</a>. Not all insurance companies cover properties used for short-term rentals, but we can. Just ask us about it!</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Landlord insurance covers the risks associated with renting your property.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"howlandlordinsuranceworksworks\">How Landlord Insurance Works {#works}</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re doing peer-to-peer rental through Airbnb or using your property as a regular rental space for full-time tenants, the best place to start is to talk to your insurance provider directly and be frank about how you plan to use your property.</p>\n<p>It’s in everyone’s best interest for you to have appropriate coverage. If anything changes along the way, update your insurance coverage as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Why? You want to cover your back. After all, an income-producing rental property doesn’t live up to its name if you’re refinancing it to pay off a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>Here are a few hypothetical examples to demonstrate the ways your landlord insurance can save you from a major unexpected expense.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario #1:</strong> <strong>Your tenant throws a rager.</strong> You rent out one investment property down the street from your house. One of your tenants throws a party: guests get wasted and one of them falls down an exterior flight of stairs. Your landlord insurance can help you pay for his medical bills because they’re your stairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario #2: The old slip-and-fall.</strong> Say you decide to rent your apartment out, and you forget to de-ice the sidewalk one winter. If your tentant's guest is injured, they can sue you for their damages.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario #3: Your rental property catches on fire.</strong> If your residential rental property catches fire, you’re likely covered for structural damage and income loss. Your policy should help you repair or replace the building, as well as replacing the income you’re not receiving from tenants during the repairs that follow. The tenant’s belongings, of course, would not be covered by your landlord insurance but <em>would</em> be covered if they carried a renters insurance policy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <h3 id=\"anincomeproducingrentalpropertydoesntliveuptoitsnameifyourerefinancingittopayoffalawsuit\">An income-producing rental property doesn’t live up to its name if you’re refinancing it to pay off a lawsuit.</h3>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"otherconsiderationshomewarrantyinsurancewarranty\">Other Considerations: Home Warranty Insurance {#warranty}</h2>\n<p>You may want to consider <a href=\"/blog/what-is-home-warranty-insurance/\">home warranty insurance</a> for property that manufacturer warranties don’t cover or for those that have aged out of their warranties. This can be a huge cost saver as you scale up your portfolio of investment properties (no pressure), even if you have a trusted maintenance contractor on speed dial.</p>\n<p>As you outfit your investment property, shop for appliances that come with a warranty that includes regular service. The days of Sears may be over, but their maintenance model isn’t. As part of the research process for buying major home appliances for yourself or for a rental property, keep an eye out for warranties that pack extra value (and coverage) into your purchase.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this goes without saying, but you should really hold onto your paperwork. Here in the digital age, if you don’t receive an electronic copy of your receipts and documents, be sure to scan and file them right away.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendoyouneedlandlordinsuranceneed\">When Do You Need Landlord Insurance? {#need}</h2>\n<p>The question of landlord vs. homeowner insurance is complicated. Your house and investment properties are complex assets, and they should have tailored insurance that is appropriate to your arrangement.</p>\n<p>This is the kind of thing that isn’t supposed to be simple, and (thankfully) it’s not something you have to figure out on your own.

That’s true if you have a lakeside cottage, a cabin near the ski slopes, or an ocean-view condo along your favorite coast.</p>\n<p>Second home insurance offers the same types of coverage as your primary home's <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policy</a>. It will cover the structure of the home, other structures (such as fences, garage, greenhouse, etc.), belongings and furnishings, loss of use, personal liability, and medical payments. Its limits are simply adjusted to account for a vacation home’s unique risks.</p>\n<p>From an insurance standpoint, a seasonal home tends to be \"riskier\" than your primary home because it's unoccupied for a good portion of the year. Homes that sit vacant can be more attractive to thieves. It also means if the home experiences damage, like a leak or fire, the damage may be more extensive because it may take longer to notice and address.</p>\n<p>That increased risk means some insurers won’t offer coverage for second homes, but <strong>Kin does</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatsecondhomeinsurancecoverscover\">What Second Home Insurance Covers {#cover}</h2>\n<p>→ <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Your Dwelling</a><br />\n→ <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Other Structures</a><br />\n→ <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal Liability</a><br />\n→ <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Personal Property</a><br />\n→ <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Loss of Use</a><br />\n→ <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical Payments</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"whyyourprimaryhomeinsurancepolicycantcoveryourvacationhome\">Why Your Primary Home Insurance Policy Can’t Cover Your Vacation Home</h2>\n<p>A single <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> policy offers a variety of coverage, but you usually can’t insure two separate homes under the same policy. The policies for your home and vacation home may be packaged and paid for together, but you technically have separate coverage for each.</p>\n<p>And that’s a good thing! This ensures each home has coverage tailored to its risks. So while your primary home may be in Ohio and not have a need for hurricane and <a href=\"/flood-insurance\">flood coverage</a>, your vacation home in Florida, which is at greater risk of hurricanes and flooding, is appropriately protected for those events.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoessecondhomeinsurancecostcost\">How Much Does Second Home Insurance Cost? {#cost}</h2>\n<p>Seasonal home insurance costs depend on where your vacation home is, how long it’s occupied each year (and by who), its age and construction, and its security measures. The types of coverage your second home needs will also impact your rates. For example, a seasonal home in Florida may need flood insurance to protect it from hurricane damage, and that will increase the overall cost to insure it.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at some pricing variables in more detail so you know what drives the cost of your policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"secondhomelocation\">Second Home Location</h3>\n<p>Your seasonal home’s location is usually the biggest impact on the price of your policy. Generally speaking, homes close to the coast cost more to insure because they face a greater chance of experiencing a named storm or hurricane. These homes will also require flood insurance – a standard home insurance policy doesn’t cover damage from storm surges.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, homes in California – especially those near canyons or places with a lot of trees or brush – may cost more because of their wildfire exposure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"occupancy\">Occupancy</h3>\n<p>If you use your second home as a vacation home, the time it sits vacant can be a real risk. Unoccupied homes face a greater chance of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Burglary</li>\n<li>Vandalism</li>\n<li>Unaddressed damage, like fires, leaks, and infestation</li>\n<li>Liability from trespassers who are injured on your property</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you might have guessed, all these factors may increase your second home insurance cost. On the other hand, if your vacation home is in a secured community where someone is around to keep an eye on your property while you’re away, your rates may be lower.</p>\n<p>If you rent out your second home when you’re not around, you may need a different kind of insurance altogether: landlord insurance. Your agent can help determine when this coverage is appropriate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ageconstruction\">Age &amp; Construction</h3>\n<p>Depending on how and when your seasonal home was built, your rates may increase or decrease. For example, homes built before 2001 in Florida may not be as resistant to hurricane winds, which can increase your premium. Homes built after may cost less to insure because they are built according to a stricter building code that prioritizes wind mitigation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"specialfeatures\">Special Features</h3>\n<p>If your vacation home has a <a href=\"/blog/swimming-pool-insurance-requirements/\">swimming pool</a>, it may cost more to insure it. That’s because pools pose liability risks for a homeowner if someone is injured in or near them.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, vacation homes that have security and safety features, such as a centrally monitored security system, water leak detection system, fire alarm, and fire and wind mitigation systems, may have significantly reduced rates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"yourhistory\">Your History</h3>\n<p>Your personal history impacts your insurance costs, too. If you don’t have any claims and you have a <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-score-explained/\">strong insurance score</a>, your premium may be lower.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wheretofindseasonalhomeinsurancewhere\">Where to Find Seasonal Home Insurance {#where}</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/orange-houses.jpg?width=969&name=orange-houses.jpg\" alt=\"\" />While not every insurance company offers coverage for second and seasonal homes, Kin is excited to offer insurance for vacation and second homes in Florida and California. When you apply for coverage, just note that the home is occupied for six months or less each year. We’ll make sure you get the appropriate coverage.</p>\n<p>Here are a couple tips if you decide to shop around:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don’t compare on price alone</strong> – it doesn’t make sense to pay a little less for a policy that offers significantly less coverage.</li>\n<li><strong>Invest in security features</strong> – it’s a great way to keep your second home safe and help you <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">save on your insurance</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/reviews\"><strong>Read the reviews</strong></a> – a good company will issue a good policy. A great company will treat you as though they were insuring a family member’s home.</li>\n</ul>"

The insurance needs of a single-family home are much different than the needs of a condo or rental unit. Policy forms help tailor coverage to fit those homes.</p>\n<p>These are the eight types of home insurance policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/ho1-policy/\">HO1 Policy – Basic Coverage</a>: This covers an owner-occupied standalone home against 10 named perils.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/ho2-policy/\">HO2 Policy – Broad Coverage</a>: This can cover the home against 16 named perils.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 Policy – Special Coverage</a>: This is the most common type of homeowners insurance. It offers replacement cost coverage for the home and covers all perils except those the policy names as exclusions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/ho4-policy/\">HO4 Policy – Contents Broad Coverage for Renters</a>: This provides coverage for a renter’s belongings, personal liability, and loss of use.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/ho5-policy/\">HO5 Policy – Comprehensive Coverage</a>: This protects the home and personal property for their replacement cost. It also covers all perils except those named as exclusions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/ho6-policy/\">HO6 Policy – Condo Unit Owners Coverage</a>: This policy protects the interior of a condo, belongings, loss of use, personal liability, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/ho7-policy/\">HO7 Policy – Mobile Home Coverage</a>: This is like an HO3 policy but for folks who have mobile or manufactured homes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/ho8-policy/\">HO8 Policy: Modified Coverage</a>: This policy insures older homes with replacement costs that outweigh their market value. It offers coverage for 10 named perils.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s look at each one in more detail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ho1basicform\">HO-1 Basic Form</h2>\n<p>In today’s world, the <a href=\"/glossary/ho1-policy/\">HO1 policy</a> is rarely used because its coverage is so limited, It only covers damage to your home from 10 <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">named perils</a> and insures your home at its actual cash value. That means your home is only covered for its depreciated value, not what it would actually cost to rebuild it today.</p>\n<p>For example, it may cost $120,000 to rebuild your home given today’s cost of labor and materials. But if your home’s actual cash value is only $90,000, you’d need to come up with the $30,000 difference to rebuild.</p>\n<p>HO1 covers damage to your home from 10 named perils:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fire or lightning</li>\n<li>Windstorm or hail</li>\n<li>Explosion</li>\n<li>Aircraft</li>\n<li>Riot or civil commotion</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Vehicles</li>\n<li>Vandalism</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Falling objects</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This policy <strong>doesn’t</strong> cover your belongings, other structures, personal liability, loss of use, or medical payments. It only covers your dwelling. Homeowners may opt for this policy if their home doesn’t qualify for a higher level of coverage or if the home is usually vacant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ho2broadform\">HO-2 Broad Form</h2>\n<p>An <a href=\"/glossary/ho2-policy/\">HO2 policy</a> is an upgrade from the HO1. It covers the home for its replacement cost and your belongings for their actual cash value. It protects your home and the things in it against 16 named perils:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fire or lightning</li>\n<li>Windstorm or hail</li>\n<li>Explosion</li>\n<li>Aircraft</li>\n<li>Riot or civil commotion</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Vehicles</li>\n<li>Vandalism</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Falling objects</li>\n<li>Weight of ice, snow, or sleet</li>\n<li>Accidental discharge or overflow of water or stream</li>\n<li>Freezing</li>\n<li>Volcanic eruption</li>\n<li>Sudden, accidental tearing apart, cracking, or burning or a built-in appliance such as a water heater or an oven</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental damage from a generated electrical current</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unlike HO1, the HO2 form covers other structures, belongings, personal liability, loss of use, and medical payments coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ho3specialform\">HO-3 Special Form</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policy</a> is the most popular homeowners policy because it’s a good balance between robust coverage and affordable premiums. In fact, 79 percent of homeowners policies issued are HO3 policies, according to <a href=\"https://www.naic.org/prod_serv/HMR-ZU-19.pdf\">2017 data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners</a>.</p>\n<p>The Kin HO3 policy covers your belongings at their replacement cost against the 16 named perils in the HO2 form. With some HO3 policies, that replacement cost coverage for your belongings must be added on.</p>\n<p>Your home gets far more coverage, too. The HO3 policy covers your home and other structures on an all-risk basis. That means it covers all sources of loss or damage except those the policy lists as exclusions, usually:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ordinance or law</li>\n<li>Earth movement</li>\n<li>Backup of sewer or drain</li>\n<li>Power failure</li>\n<li>Neglect</li>\n<li>War</li>\n<li>Nuclear hazard</li>\n<li>Intentional loss</li>\n<li>Government action</li>\n<li>Theft to a dwelling under construction</li>\n<li>Vandalism from vacancy of 60 days or more</li>\n<li>Mold, fungus, or rot</li>\n<li>Wear and tear</li>\n<li>Mechanical breakdown</li>\n<li>Smog, rust, or corrosion</li>\n<li>Smoke from industrial operations or agricultural smudging</li>\n<li>Discharge, dispersal, or seepage of pollutants</li>\n<li>Settling, shrinking, bulging, or expanding of structure such as foundation</li>\n<li>Birds, vermin, rodents, insects</li>\n<li>Animals owned by insured</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It also covers loss of use, personal liability, and medical payments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ho4contentsbroadform\">HO-4 Contents Broad Form</h2>\n<p>An <a href=\"/glossary/ho4-policy/\">HO4 policy</a>, also called renters insurance, covers only belongings and personal liability. It can be purchased for any type of property (condo, single-family, apartment) if it’s leased.</p>\n<p>Unlike other home insurance policies, HO4 doesn’t cover your dwelling or other buildings on the premises. That’s because it’s up to your landlord to insure these structures.</p>\n<p>Belongings are typically protected against 16 named perils:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fire or lightning</li>\n<li>Windstorm or hail</li>\n<li>Explosion</li>\n<li>Riot or civil commotion</li>\n<li>Aircraft</li>\n<li>Vehicles</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Vandalism</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Volcanic eruption</li>\n<li>Falling object</li>\n<li>Weight of ice, snow, or sleet</li>\n<li>Accidental water overflow or steam</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning, or bulging of certain household systems</li>\n<li>Freezing</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental damage from artificially generated electrical current</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most renters policies cover your belongings anywhere in the world. It also offers personal liability, loss of use, and medical payments coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ho5comprehensiveform\">HO-5 Comprehensive Form</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/glossary/ho5-policy/\">HO5 policy</a> is usually for high-value properties in high-risk areas. As the name suggests, this policy offers comprehensive coverage similar to our HO3. Both policies cover the home, other structures, and belongings at their replacement cost. But there are some key differences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HO5s offers all-risk coverage for your home <em>and</em> belongings. Remember, HO3 defaults to named-perils coverage for belongings.</li>\n<li>The HO-5 policy usually offers higher coverage limits for expensive belongings like electronics, jewelry, and furs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For most homeowners, the extra coverage is not worth the extra premium when the HO3 covers similar losses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ho6unitownersform\">HO-6 Unit-Owners Form</h2>\n<p>Also called condo insurance, the <a href=\"/glossary/ho6-policy/\">HO6 policy</a> covers a condo unit owner’s interior, belongings, loss of use, personal liability, and medical payments. The HO6 policy complements the <a href=\"/glossary/hoa-insurance/\">HOA’s master insurance policy</a>, which typically covers the exterior of the condo and shared property (like terraces, pools, hallways, etc.). Condo insurance covers the part of the unit that the owner is responsible for – the walls, ceiling, floors, and fixtures.</p>\n<p>Because the condo insurance policy works with the master policy, it also includes <a href=\"/condo-insurance/loss-assessment-coverage/\">loss assessment coverage</a>. This kicks in when you’re responsible for helping cover damage or repairs to shared property. For example, if your condo association files a claim on the master policy, unit owners may need to chip in to cover the deductible. Loss assessment coverage can help cover that unexpected cost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ho7mobilehomeform\">HO-7 Mobile Home Form</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/glossary/ho7-policy/\">HO7 policy</a> is for <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/\">mobile homes</a>, including single-wide, double-wide, or triple-wide mobile or manufactured homes. It’s also referred to as an MH3 policy because it’s like the HO3 policy for homeowners but designed to protect the unique characteristics of a mobile home.</p>\n<p>The policy covers the mobile home itself, other structures on the property (like fences or sheds), belongings, personal liability, and loss of use, and medical payments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ho8modifiedcoverageform\">HO-8 Modified Coverage Form</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/glossary/ho8-policy/\">HO8 policy</a> is the go-to policy for older, <a href=\"/blog/high-risk-homeowners-insurance/\">high-risk homes</a>. These homes may have a difficult time getting other coverage because they may not meet underwriting requirements. For example, these homes may have outdated electrical wiring, which can be a fire risk. For that reason, their replacement cost may outweigh the home’s value.</p>\n<p>An HO8 policy may be a good fit your home is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Older, especially more than 40 years old.</li>\n<li>A registered landmark.</li>\n<li>An architecturally significant home.</li>\n<li>Constructed of hard-to-replace materials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The HO8 covers the home for its actual cash value against 10 named perils like the HO1:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fire or lightning</li>\n<li>Windstorm or hail</li>\n<li>Explosion</li>\n<li>Aircraft</li>\n<li>Riot or civil commotion</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Vehicles</li>\n<li>Vandalism</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Falling objects</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unlike the HO1, it also covers other structures, belongings, loss of use, personal liability, and medical payments.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisumbrellainsurance\">What Is Umbrella Insurance?</h2>\n<p>An umbrella policy supplements the liability coverage offered by your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> and personal auto insurance. If a claim against you exceeds your available liability coverage, an umbrella policy can help make up the difference.</p>\n<p>Basically, an umbrella policy acts like an extra layer of protection. It lays on top of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage</a> and extends its limits. This is why you can’t buy an umbrella policy unless you have a home insurance or auto policy first.</p>\n<p>You also must have a minimum amount of primary liability coverage before you can purchase an umbrella policy. For us, that typically means $300,000 in personal liability coverage and $500,000 in per accident auto liability coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howdoesumbrellacoveragework\">How Does Umbrella Coverage Work?</h3>\n<p>The liability portion of homeowner’s insurance and auto insurance covers damage you may be responsible for, like a visitor's injury that happens on your property or car accidents involving you. So say that visitor took such a spill on your front porch that their medical bills far surpass the $300,000 you have in liability protection. They want you to pay for the full $350,000 they've racked up in medical bills and missed work.</p>\n<p>This is where umbrella insurance can help out. Instead of paying the remaining $50,000 out of pocket after your insurance covers $300,000 of the claim, you can draw on your umbrella policy to pay it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can draw on umbrella insurance when you need extra liability coverage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"whatdoesumbrellainsurancecover\">What Does Umbrella Insurance Cover?</h3>\n<p>Because an umbrella policy extends the limits of the underlying liability insurance, it typically covers incidents your home and auto insurance cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bodily injuries to other people</li>\n<li>Property damage you cause</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if you've ever been in an auto accident, if your dog ever bites the mailman, or if your kid ever hits a baseball through the neighbor's window… these are all situations when your umbrella insurance may need to step in if the claim gets too expensive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatumbrellainsurancedoesntcover\">What Umbrella Insurance Doesn't Cover</h3>\n<p>It doesn’t usually pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your own injuries</li>\n<li>Residents' injuries</li>\n<li>Damage to your own property</li>\n<li>Liability claims against your business</li>\n<li>Damage and injuries caused by intentional or criminal acts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Give us a heads up if you use recreational vehicles, like an ATV. While some insurers won't cover damage associated with these vehicles, we can help keep you protected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendoyouneedanumbrellapolicy\">When Do You Need an Umbrella Policy?</h2>\n<p>Homeowners with a high net worth may want to consider umbrella coverage. The logic here is the more money someone has, the more likely they are to be <a href=\"/blog/4-times-for-liability-insurance/\">targeted with a lawsuit</a>. However, there are plenty of other situations that may increase your likelihood for an expensive lawsuit.</p>\n<p>That's why you may want to consider an umbrella policy if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are a landlord</li>\n<li>Coach youth sports</li>\n<li>Volunteer</li>\n<li>Serve on a board</li>\n<li>Own a pool or trampoline</li>\n<li>Host a lot of parties or gatherings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That list isn't exhaustive, so think about the risks you face. Ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can I cover a lawsuit out of pocket?</li>\n<li>How valuable is my property?</li>\n<li>Do I regularly take part in activities where I might accidentally hurt someone?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These questions can help you decide if an umbrella policy is right for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchisumbrellainsurance\">How Much Is Umbrella Insurance?</h2>\n<p>Adding an umbrella policy contributes to your overall <a href=\"/insurance-resources/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">costs</a>, but you might be surprised by how affordable it is. Policies can cost as little as $100 for $1 million in additional coverage.</p>\n<p>You can typically choose up to $5 million in umbrella coverage, but as you might've guessed, the more coverage you select, the higher the premium.</p>\n<p>Your driving activity and the age of drivers on your auto insurance plan may influence the cost of an umbrella policy, too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"doeskinofferumbrellainsurance\">Does Kin Offer Umbrella Insurance?</h3>\n<p>Not yet, but stay tuned!
