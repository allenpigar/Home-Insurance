It’s a laid-back city designed to feel intimate as a small town with the amenities of a big city.</p>\n<p>But Clearwater and its surrounding cities are the <a href=\"https://www.bestplaces.net/docs/studies/hurricane_hotspots.aspx\">fourth most likely</a> to get hit by a major hurricane. The potential for a bad hurricane, flooding, and sinkhole risk make finding affordable <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> in Clearwater a challenge.</p>\n<p>That said, Clearwater policyholders pay about $1,206 a year on average with Kin, well below the average premium for other carriers. If you’re interested in saving some money, <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">get a quote today</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"clearwaterhomeinsurancecosts\">Clearwater Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Homeowners insurance in Florida</a> is known for being some of the most expensive in the nation. For all carriers, the state’s average homeowners insurance policy costs $1,951 a year, whereas Kin’s Florida policies average $1,354 a year. Clearwater home insurance costs an average of $1,206 with Kin, though prices vary depending on your home, its construction and age, and other factors.</p>\n<p>To see how much prices vary based on carrier, take a look at the chart below. These rates are based on the value and construction of homes in Clearwater (part of Pinellas County).</p>\n<p>| Average Clearwater Home Insurance Premiums by Carrier x Home Value |</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Value of Home</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Security First</th>\n<th>Universal Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company</th>\n<th>Tower Hill Preferred</th>\n<th>State Farm</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction, No Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$1,290</td>\n<td>$2,107</td>\n<td>$2,792</td>\n<td>$2,738</td>\n<td>$3,532</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction w/ Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$970</td>\n<td>$1,404</td>\n<td>$1,237</td>\n<td>$1,583</td>\n<td>$2,332</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> New Construction</td>\n<td>$1,359</td>\n<td>$2,433</td>\n<td>$2,441</td>\n<td>$2,731</td>\n<td>$4,138</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Pay special attention to the price difference between a small, older home with wind mitigation measures versus no wind mitigation measures. Wind mitigation can be the difference between a home weathering a hurricane and being completely destroyed, and the cost of your coverage reflects that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"clearwaterhomeinsurancebasics\">Clearwater Home Insurance Basics</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance can be confusing if you’ve never purchased it before, so let’s simplify it. These are the most important part of your policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: This is how much you have to rebuild or repair your home after a covered claim.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: This is protection for other structures on your property, including your garage, fence, shed, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property insurance</strong></a>: Your belongings make your house a home, and this part of your policy protects them.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: When your home is under repair for a covered claim, this helps you pay for expenses when you must temporarily live elsewhere.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: If you’re sued over damage you accidentally cause to someone’s property, this helps pay for legal expenses.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: When someone has a small injury on your property, this can help cover their medical bills.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every home is different, so your policy may include coverages beyond these basics. Talk to your Kin representative for help tailoring your policy to your needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coveringspecificrisksinclearwaterflorida\">Covering Specific Risks in Clearwater, Florida</h2>\n<p>Clearwater home insurance policies cover the standard perils, such as fire, wind damage, vandalism, and theft. That a good thing considering Clearwater’s crime rate is <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/fl/clearwater/crime\">74 percent higher than average</a> for Florida cities.</p>\n<p>But it’s also important to understand how your insurance addresses major catastrophes. Let’s take a look.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clearwaterhurricanecoverage\">Clearwater Hurricane Coverage</h3>\n<p>Clearwater sits along the central western shore of Florida. If a hurricane from the Gulf of Mexico doesn’t make landfall farther south, Clearwater could experience a direct hit. Its most recent brush with a major storm was Hurricane Irma in 2017. Fortunately, Irma was downgraded to a Category 1 storm before it hit Clearwater.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">Hurricane insurance</a>, included in all Kin policies, pays for damage from the high winds of the storm. During a hurricane, extreme winds can blow off roofs and completely destroy homes. When you make a hurricane claim, your hurricane deductible applies. This is usually a flat $500 or 2 percent, 5 percent, or 10 percent of your dwelling coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clearwaterfloodinsurance\">Clearwater Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>Most hurricanes bring severe storm surge with them. The barrier islands and coastal areas of Clearwater are most susceptible to flooding, though the entire region has risky flood zones. It’s important for homeowners to understand that neither homeowners nor hurricane insurance will cover floods.</p>\n<p>Even one inch of water can lead to thousands of dollars in damage. That’s why Kin offers a low-cost <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood endorsement</a> to help you protect your home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sinkholecoverageinclearwater\">Sinkhole Coverage in Clearwater</h3>\n<p>Clearwater’s low ocean level areas are prone to sinkholes. With the high concentration of limestone in the state and its history of flooding, the ground is susceptible to collapse.</p>\n<p>Kin policies include coverage for catastrophic ground cover collapse to help address this risk. For more robust protection, we also offer <a href=\"/glossary/sinkhole-insurance/\">sinkhole insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforloweringclearwaterhomeinsurancerates\">Tips for Lowering Clearwater Home Insurance Rates</h2>\n<p>Don’t pay more for your coverage than you have to. The key to saving money long-term on your coverage is to avoid making claims when possible. If you can handle a small repair on your own, you’ll benefit over time.</p>\n<p>Another way to <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">save on your home insurance</a> is to invest in risk management, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Installing protective devices.</li>\n<li>Reinforcing your roof.</li>\n<li>Installing hurricane shutters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wind mitigation credits can often help you save 20 to 25 percent on your premium each year.</p>\n<p>We also offer <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Living in a secured community.</li>\n<li>Having a home less than six years old.</li>\n<li>Signing up for an electronic policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have any questions about getting insured in Clearwater, call us at <a href=\"tel:855-717-0022\">855-717-0022</a>.</p>"

Located on the Emerald Coast, it’s famous for its sugar-sand beaches and sparkling emerald water. It’s little wonder so many Floridians call this city home.</p>\n<p>Also known as “The World’s Luckiest Fishing Village,” Destin has one of the largest fishing vessel fleets in all of Florida. Its residents are all too familiar with the sea’s power, as hurricanes often hit the Panhandle's coast. That reality impacts homeowners insurance rates in the area, though you may be able to save with Kin. Our policyholders pay $1,128 a year on average for home insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"destinhomeinsurancecosts\">Destin Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>As a Destin homeowner, you’re probably familiar with the high cost of <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> – the state’s average premium among all carriers is $1,951 a year. Kin has worked hard to build an affordable policy that addresses key concerns for the region. The result is a policy starting as low as $907 a year – well below the state's average.</p>\n<p>Compare the average premiums of other home insurance providers in Destin below.

Aside from these standard perils, every homeowner in Destin, Florida should look at how their insurance covers them for major catastrophes such as hurricanes, floods, and sinkholes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"destinhurricanecoverage\">Destin Hurricane Coverage</h3>\n<p>In 2018, Destin felt the effects of Hurricane Michael. Although Destin was west and didn’t receive a direct hit from the storm, it experienced heavy winds and damage from fallen trees and flying debris. This part of the Panhandle could experience devastating damage after a hurricane’s direct hit.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for Kin policyholders, <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a> is included. This coverage pays for damage caused by fierce hurricane winds. Your Kin representative will recommend a hurricane deductible that fits your needs – you have <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">several options</a> to choose from.</p>\n<h3 id=\"destinfloodinsurance\">Destin Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>As a low-lying coastal city, Destin is subject to storm surges and flooding. Hurricane insurance will not cover the losses resulting from storm surge; you flood insurance for that.</p>\n<p>Kin offers a [flood insurance](flood insurance/) endorsement, an affordable alternative to a separate flood policy that offers broader coverage, too.

Those who live here enjoy resort-style amenities that also accommodate daily life.</p>\n<p>It’s no surprise that the city famous for its beaches and water sports and that holds the International Swimming Hall of Fame finds itself in high waters often. The barrage of hurricanes, tropical storms, and flooding can make finding affordable <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> in Fort Lauderdale a little challenging.</p>\n<p>When comparing prices of homeowners insurance, Fort Lauderdale is often more expensive than other Florida cities because of its history of natural disasters and the typically higher-value homes in the area. On average, Kin policyholders in Fort Lauderdale pay $2,075 a year for their homeowners insurance, though rates vary depending on the value of your home and other factors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fortlauderdalehomeinsurancecosts\">Fort Lauderdale Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Florida is among the states with the highest <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">average home insurance premiums</a> – national data puts that cost at $1,951 a year. But the insurer you choose can drastically impact how much you pay for coverage. For example, Kin’s Florida policyholders pay $1,354 a year on average.</p>\n<p>There is no cookie-cutter approach to homeowners insurance. Personal quotes consider the exact location of your home, your claims history, and the many qualities your home, including size, age, and construction type.</p>\n<p>Comparing the cost of homeowners insurance in Fort Lauderdale (part of Broward County), you see the costs vary widely between Kin and other insurance companies.</p>\n<p>| Average Fort Lauderdale Home Insurance Premiums by Carrier x Home Value |</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Value of Home</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Security First</th>\n<th>Universal Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company</th>\n<th>Tower Hill Preferred</th>\n<th>State Farm</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction, No Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$2,443</td>\n<td>$5,154</td>\n<td>$7,708</td>\n<td>$6,136</td>\n<td>$5,607</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction w/ Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$1,749</td>\n<td>$2,687</td>\n<td>$2,314</td>\n<td>$3,089</td>\n<td>$3,430</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> New Construction</td>\n<td>$2,035</td>\n<td>$4,073</td>\n<td>$4,198</td>\n<td>$5,367</td>\n<td>$5,185</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>What those prices don’t tell you is that Kin’s prices include hurricane coverage. Also pay particular attention to how much money you can save by having <a href=\"/glossary/wind-mitigation/\">wind mitigation components</a> installed in your home. It’s nearly a $750 annual savings.</p>\n<p>While Kin pulls thousands of data points about each home to make applying for coverage easy, it’s important to talk to your representative if you’ve made recent upgrades. You’ll want your coverage to be able to replace higher-end materials, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Granite countertops</li>\n<li>Hardwood floors</li>\n<li>Specialty items, like hot tubs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An accurate policy makes claims easier – you don’t want to be surprised by coverage shortfalls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"basicsoffortlauderdalehomeinsurance\">Basics of Fort Lauderdale Home Insurance</h2>\n<p>Your home insurance policy is more than just coverage for your actual home. When <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">buying homeowners insurance</a> in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, make sure you have coverage for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The dwelling’s replacement cost</strong>: This is the amount to rebuild the structure of your home to it’s pre-claim condition.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal property</strong>: This insures the total value of your personal belongings (clothing, electronics, appliances, home goods, etc.).</li>\n<li><strong>Loss of use</strong>: This pays for you to stay in a hotel or rent a home while your covered home repairs are underway.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal liability</strong>: This is your protection for third-party lawsuits against you, such as when your dog bites a neighbor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may have coverage needs beyond these basics. For help customizing your policy, chat with a Kin representative.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fortlauderdalefloridasbiggestperils\">Fort Lauderdale, Florida’s Biggest Perils</h2>\n<p>Fort Lauderdale home insurance policies cover standard <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a>, such as fire, theft, and water damage caused by burst pipes. It’s important to have reliable homeowners insurance in Fort Lauderdale because it has one of the <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/fl/fort-lauderdale/crime\">highest crime rates</a> in the country. Additionally, homeowners should understand how their policy addresses natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, and sinkholes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fortlauderdalehurricanecoverage\">Fort Lauderdale Hurricane Coverage</h3>\n<p>More tropical storms and hurricanes hit Florida than any other state, and Fort Lauderdale’s location in the southeast part of the state makes it a prime target for damage. Fort Lauderdale has been hit directly or nearly directly by the eye of Hurricanes Andrew, Wilma, and Katrina, to name a few. More recently, <a href=\"https://www.worldvision.org/disaster-relief-news-stories/2017-hurricane-irma-facts\">Hurricane Irma</a> devastated the area as a Category 3 storm with winds exceeding 110 miles per hour.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">Hurricane home insurance</a> pays for claims resulting from the high winds of the storm, such as when a hurricane rips the roof off a home or debris breaks its windows. Kin policies include hurricane insurance – all you need to do is choose the hurricane deductible (a $500 flat fee or 2 percent, 5 percent, or 10 percent of the home’s replacement cost).</p>\n<h3 id=\"fortlauderdalefloodinsurance\">Fort Lauderdale Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://gyr.fortlauderdale.gov/greener-government/climate-resiliency/floodplain-management/flood-zones-in-fort-lauderdale/flood-zone-designations-flood-maps\">the city of Fort Lauderdale</a>, the majority of residents live in or close to a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), creating high risk of flooding from heaving rains or storm surges. Remember that hurricane insurance won’t cover storm surges or rises in ground water during a hurricane. Only flood insurance does that.</p>\n<p>Understanding that even one inch of water can lead to significant structural and property damage, Kin created a <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood endorsement</a> that can easily be added to your homeowners policy. This enables homeowners to save money and eliminate coverage gaps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sinkholecoverageinfortlauderdale\">Sinkhole Coverage in Fort Lauderdale</h3>\n<p>Sinkholes can happen in any part of Florida due to the high concentration of limestone in the ground. When limestone is saturated, it softens and begins to erode. Significant erosion can create sinkholes.</p>\n<p>The good news for Fort Lauderdale residents is that Brower County has a lower risk of sinkholes than other parts of the state. Kin’s policies include <a href=\"/glossary/sinkhole-insurance/\">catastrophic ground cover collapse</a>, which helps protect residents in lower-risk areas.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/home%20insurance%20discounts%202.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforloweringfortlauderdalehomeinsurancecosts\">Tips for Lowering Fort Lauderdale Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>When shopping for coverage, look for <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">homeowners insurance discounts</a>. For example, Kin customers in Fort Lauderdale are often eligible for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Protective device discounts</strong>: Let your representative know if you’ve installed smoke alarms, security systems, and water mitigation devices.</li>\n<li><strong>Wind mitigation credits</strong>: Your impact-resistant doors and windows and reinforced roofing may earn you serious savings.</li>\n<li><strong>Secure community discounts</strong>: Living in a gated community with or without guards can fetch you a reduced premium.</li>\n<li><strong>New construction discounts</strong>: Homes under six years of age are often eligible for a reduced rate.</li>\n<li><strong>Electronic policy discounts</strong>: When you opt for online policy management and billing, you earn an easy discount.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep in mind that the best way to save money over the long haul is to have a clean claims record. While this may be difficult in areas like Fort Lauderdale, taking preventative measures goes a long way.</p>\n<p>For example, installing a reinforced roof can often save you more than 20 percent on your homeowners insurance premium.</p>\n<p>Ready to get a homeowners insurance policy with hurricane, flood, and sinkhole coverage?

With over 600 miles of white sand beaches, living here is the perfect backdrop for both curiosity and discovery. In fact, U.S. News ranks it as the 35th best place to live in the United States and the <a href=\"https://realestate.usnews.com/places/florida/fort-myers\">number one place to retire</a>.</p>\n<p>However, the Southwestern Florida coast is a favorite destination for hurricanes and flooding as well. In addition to weather threats, the ground is constantly shifting, creating major sinkhole problems. These risks make finding <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> a bit tricky. Many major carriers have pulled out of underwriting homes, leaving homeowners scrambling for proper coverage.</p>\n<p>A small home with strong wind mitigation measures in Fort Myers may cost as little as $853 annually to insure, but the average Kin premium in this city is $1,027 a year. Rates can increase depending on the size of your home, the types of materials used in building your home, its proximity to the shoreline, and other factors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fortmyershomeownersinsurancecosts\">Fort Myers Homeowners Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Home insurance rates vary depending on the size of your home, your home’s construction, your claims history, and your home’s location. Kin’s average annual price of homeowners insurance in Florida is $1,354. Fort Myers costs range widely depending on the carrier – from $853 (with Kin) to upwards of $4,000 a year.</p>\n<p>Comparing the cost of homeowners insurance in Fort Myers (part of Lee County), you see the costs vary widely between Kin and other insurance companies.</p>\n<p>| Average Fort Myers Home Insurance Premiums by Carrier x Home Value |</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Value of Home</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Security First</th>\n<th>Universal Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company</th>\n<th>Tower Hill Preferred</th>\n<th>State Farm</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction, No Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$1,147</td>\n<td>$3,275</td>\n<td>$3,642</td>\n<td>$2,528</td>\n<td>$3,781</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction w/ Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$853</td>\n<td>$1,825</td>\n<td>$1,658</td>\n<td>$1,397</td>\n<td>$2,342</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> New Construction</td>\n<td>$1,082</td>\n<td>$3,439</td>\n<td>$3,243</td>\n<td>$2,436</td>\n<td>$4,160</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As you can see above, the value of your home and its construction can have a substantial impact on how much you pay for coverage in Fort Myers. For example, laminate floors are less expensive to replace than hardwood floors. Custom crown molding is a higher-cost finish than a home without crown molding. All of these details affect the replacement cost of your dwelling and, ultimately, the premium.</p>\n<p>While averages give you an idea of insurance costs in your area, getting a quote is the only way to know how much your homeowners insurance premium will be.</p>\n<h2 id=\"basicsofhomeownersinsurancefortmyersflorida\">Basics of Homeowners Insurance, Fort Myers, Florida</h2>\n<p>When buying home insurance, you want to protect the structure, your belongings, and yourself against liability. Make sure you have the following <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance protection</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost coverage</strong>: Repairs or rebuilds your home to its pre-claim condition.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal property coverage</strong>: Fixes or replaces personal items damaged, lost, or stolen in a covered claim.</li>\n<li><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong>: Gives you a place to stay while your home is uninhabitable during a covered claim.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong>: Protects you when people sue you over injuries or property damage you are responsible for (e.g., your dog bites someone on a walk).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those are the very basics of what your policy should cover. Talk to a Kin representative about your home and risks to help you determine how much coverage makes sense for your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coveringbigrisksinfortmyersflorida\">Covering Big Risks in Fort Myers, Florida</h2>\n<p>Fort Myers home insurance can cover standard perils such as fire, theft, and water damage caused by a burst pipe. Additionally, homeowners should know how insurance responds to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, and sinkholes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fortmyershurricanecoverage\">Fort Myers Hurricane Coverage</h3>\n<p>Sitting on the southwest coast of Florida, Fort Myers is a prime target for hurricanes coming through the Gulf Coast. Hurricane Irma made landfall in 2017, and her 150 mph winds led to more than $64 billion in damages. This is why every house in Fort Myers needs hurricane insurance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">Hurricane insurance</a> specifically covers damages to your home caused by the extreme winds and flying debris during the storm. While your home’s replacement cost remains the same for the hurricane insurance, the deductible is set specifically for hurricane claims. The <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> is either a flat amount, such as $500, or a percentage of the home’s replacement cost (2 percent, 5 percent, or 10 percent) in the event of a claim.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fortmyersfloodinsurance\">Fort Myers Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://msc.fema.gov/portal/search?AddressQuery=11893%20Kemena%20Street,%20Fort%20Myers,%20FL%2033912#searchresultsanchor\">According to FEMA</a>, if you live in a low-to-moderate flood zone, you are five times more likely to experience flood damage than a house fire. Fort Myers sits on the Caloosahatchee River, which can overflow and lead to flooding during heavy rains. During a hurricane, the storm surge could be as high as nine feet, pushing miles inland as it did with Irma.</p>\n<p>It’s important to understand that hurricane insurance will not cover storm surge; only flood insurance can. Even if you don’t live on the coast, check the flood maps to see your risk throughout Lee County and Fort Myers. Kin offers a <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood endorsement</a> so that you can conveniently add flood insurance coverage to your homeowners policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sinkholecove\">Sinkhole Cove</h3>\n<h3 id=\"rage\">rage</h3>\n<p>There are sinkholes throughout Florida because when water mixes with the limestone in the ground, it softens and caves. These are not as common in Fort Myers as they are in Northern or Central Florida, but they are still a concern. Kin Insurance policies offer a provision to cover catastrophic ground cover collapse; this is often enough protection for those in areas that experience <a href=\"/glossary/sinkhole-insurance/\">sinkholes</a> less often. Talk to your Kin representative to learn more about this coverage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/home%20insurance%20discounts%202.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforkeepingfortmyersinsurancecostsdown\">Tips for Keeping Fort Myers Insurance Costs Down</h2>\n<p>Even though Florida has the highest home insurance rates in the country, there are ways to keep your costs down.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest discounts available is <a href=\"/glossary/wind-mitigation/\">wind mitigation measures</a> – homes that have impact-resistant doors and windows, as well as reinforced roofing, can save Fort Myers homeowners money. For example, a Lee County home with a replacement cost of $150,000 might have an annual premium of $1,147. With wind mitigation measures, that premium could drop to $853 each year.</p>\n<p>Other <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts for homeowners</a> include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having protective devices installed, such as fire alarms and security systems.</li>\n<li>Living in a secured community.</li>\n<li>Having a newer home under six years of age.</li>\n<li>Managing policies online.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, keeping a clean claims history can keep your costs down.

It includes the following basic protections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement-cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: This pays to rebuild your home after you've experienced a covered claim.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: This pays to replace or rebuild secondary structures on your property, such as sheds, detached garages, and guest houses.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: This pays to replace personal belongings in your home, such as clothing, furniture, appliances, electronics, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: This is an allowance for you to relocate for a short period of time while your home is being repaired or rebuilt.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: This helps pay for lawsuits and claims made against you over bodily injuries or property damage you caused.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: This pays for visitor medical bills when they are hurt on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your Kin representative can customize your policy with <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a> to meet your specific needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coveringgainesvillesbigrisks\">Covering Gainesville’s Big Risks</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance covers standard risks such as fire, non-hurricane wind damage, theft, and vandalism. As with many big college towns, crime can be an issue. Residents in Gainesville have a <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/fl/gainesville/crime\">one in 20 chance</a> of being a victim of a violent or property crime.</p>\n<p>In addition to theft, Gainesville residents should also prepare for these three major catastrophes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gainesvillehurricanecoverage\">Gainesville Hurricane Coverage</h3>\n<p>Since Gainesville still sits in the central part of Florida, it's less likely to have the catastrophic consequences of a direct hit from a hurricane. That doesn't mean there isn't hurricane risk for residents. The city still faces heavy winds that take down power lines, knock down trees, and send debris through the air.</p>\n<p>All Kin insurance policies include <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a>, which pays for damage caused by hurricane winds. When you make a hurricane claim, your hurricane deductible applies. You can choose your deductible based on a flat fee or a percentage of the home’s replacement cost. For example, you can choose a flat $500 hurricane deductible or a 2 percent deductible based on your home's replacement cost.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gainesvillefloodinsurance\">Gainesville Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>Gainesville homes are at risk of flooding. The low-lying region is riddled with poor drainage and various bodies of water that can overflow.</p>\n<p>When you think about the damage that one inch of water can do, it makes sense to have <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>. This pays for damages associated with rising water from rain or lack of drainage in the area. Ask your Kin representative to add flood coverage to your policy – it’s more affordable than you may think.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sinkholecoverageingainesville\">Sinkhole Coverage in Gainesville</h3>\n<p>Gainesville is prone to sinkholes like every other area in northern Florida. Sinkholes can wreak havoc on a home, causing collapsing floors, cracks in the foundation, and buckling walls. Without sinkhole coverage, these repairs must be made out of pocket. Talk to your Kin representative about whether <a href=\"/glossary/sinkhole-insurance/\">sinkhole coverage</a> makes sense for your home.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/home%20insurance%20discounts%202.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforkeepinggainesvillehomeinsurancecostsdown\">Tips for Keeping Gainesville Home Insurance Costs Down</h2>\n<p>Protecting your home from risk and preventing claims is the best way to <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">save on your home insurance</a>. Some measures may even result in <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> on your premium, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Installing protective or alert devices.</li>\n<li>Have strong wind mitigation measures in place.</li>\n<li>Living in a gated community.</li>\n<li>Signing up for an electronic policy.</li>\n<li>Check if you are eligible for <a href=\"/blog/florida-homestead-exemption/\">Florida Homestead Exemption</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have any questions about getting insured in Gainesville, call us at <a href=\"tel:855-717-0022\">855-717-0022</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>Whether you know this city as the First Coast or Jax, one thing is certain about Jacksonville, Florida: it’s a great place to live. Maybe that’s why <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/jacksonvillecityflorida/AFN120212\">58 percent</a> of all housing units in the city are owner-occupied and it’s the 12th fastest-growing city in America. As Florida’s largest city and the largest city by area in the continental United States, Jacksonville is home to many people, from entrepreneurs and history buffs to families who enjoy the scenery and activities the waterfront has to offer.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the same characteristics that make Jacksonville such an appealing place to live can also cause some headaches when shopping for <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a>. Homeowners have to contend with tricky exposures like flooding, hurricanes, and sinkholes. Plus, insurance for these risks has been historically cost prohibitive for many homeowners.</p>\n<p>So what coverage is and isn’t necessary for Jacksonville homes? This homeowners insurance guide can help you understand what your policy should ideally include, the cost of Jacksonville home insurance, and how much insurance you might need to protect your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeownersinsuranceforjacksonvilleflhomes\">Homeowners Insurance for Jacksonville, FL Homes</h2>\n<p>For starters, you want to make sure your homeowners insurance (also called an HO3 policy) includes these basics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost coverage</strong> for the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling</a>, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">other structures</a>, and your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">belongings</a>, which can pay to repair or replace your items with brand-new items of a similar kind and quality.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a> to pay for additional living expenses if a covered incident makes your home uninhabitable.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a> to help pay your legal bills if you’re held responsible for another person’s bodily injuries or property damage.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a> to help pay for someone’s immediate medical bills if they are injured on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pay special attention to replacement cost coverage. Some insurance providers sell actual cash value coverage, which pays out the depreciated value of an item and usually leaves homeowners underinsured when they need to rebuild the home and replace their belongings. That’s why Kin recommends replacement cost insurance.</p>\n<p>Your area’s crime rate may influence how much coverage you want for your personal belongings. For reference, Jacksonville is rated <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/fl/jacksonville/crime\">safer than only 9 percent of all other cities in the US</a>, meaning homeowners here are at a higher risk of becoming a victim of property crime than the national average. Last year, Jacksonville had 32,000 property crimes.</p>\n<p>Your personal property coverage can help you replace stolen belongings.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/JacksonvilleCrime2.png?width=600&name=JacksonvilleCrime2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>In addition to standard coverage, homeowners in Jacksonville often need a little extra protection to address the property risks unique to the area. Let’s take a look at those considerations below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodinsurance\">Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>The biggest struggle in Jacksonville is finding a home resilient to the city’s massive flooding problem, thanks to its coastal proximity. Storm surges, even after a weak hurricane, can keep the city flooded for days.</p>\n<p>In fact, the White House homeland security advisor Tom Bossert said the storm surge after Irma caused one of the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-updates-hurricane-irma-rain-and-storm-surge-create-flooding-in-1505165497-htmlstory.html\">worst floods Jacksonville has seen in 100 years</a>. Worth noting: Irma’s eye missed Jacksonville by more than 70 miles.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jacksonvilleisdangerouslyfloodpronemakingahitfromevenaweakerhurricanepotentiallycatastrophictampabaytimeshttpwwwtampabaycomprojects2017investigationsjacksonvilleneverdrainshurricane\">“[Jacksonville] is dangerously flood-prone, making a hit from even a weaker hurricane potentially catastrophic.” – <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2017/investigations/jacksonville-never-drains-hurricane/\">Tampa Bay Times</a></h3>\n<p>That’s why <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">**flood insurance **</a>is so important for homeowners in Jacksonville.</p>\n<p>Jacksonville’s flooding is often localized and caused by its active rainy thunderstorm season, but hurricane season can be especially devastating, as Irma illustrated. In fact, FEMA recently determined <a href=\"https://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/local/new-fema-flood-maps-show-more-jacksonville-beach-streets-are-at-risk/487615655\">more of Jacksonville is at risk for flooding</a> than before. You can use <a href=\"http://www.hillsboroughcounty.org/en/residents/property-owners-and-renters/homeowners-and-neighborhoods/find-my-flood-zone#/\">Find My Flood Zone</a> to determine your individual risk.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sinkholecoverage\">Sinkhole Coverage</h3>\n<p>Jacksonville, like much of Florida, is susceptible to sinkholes. Because of the natural fluctuation of seasonal downpours and dry periods, Florida’s limestone foundation faces more risk of sinkholes than other states.</p>\n<p>Sinkholes cause problems for both Florida’s infrastructure – like the sinkhole on the NAS Jacksonville runway – and homes alike. More than 17 sinkholes are reported throughout Florida <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/UserContent/Session/2011/Publications/InterimReports/pdf/2011-104bi.pdf\">on a daily basis</a>.</p>\n<p>Catastrophic ground cover collapse coverage is included in your policy and can help cover losses caused by certain types of geological activity, such as sinkholes when they cause total loss. Ask a Kin agent for more details.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/JacksonvilleSinkholes2.png?width=600&name=JacksonvilleSinkholes2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"hurricanecoverage\">Hurricane Coverage</h3>\n<p>Florida is no stranger to hurricanes, and neither is Jacksonville. The one that left the biggest impression on the state was, of course, Hurricane Andrew. This 1992 storm destroyed nearly 30,000 Florida residences and changed the way Floridians build homes altogether.</p>\n<p>Homes built after 1994 have stricter building codes to help decrease the damage incurred by hurricanes. Homes built after 2001, when another building code update took place, are stronger yet. Some changes include reinforced roofs, impact-resistant windows, and better wind protection.</p>\n<p>However, no home is completely hurricane-proof. That’s why your Kin home insurance policy includes a hurricane deductible. This protection kicks in when your home is <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">damaged by hurricane winds</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whentogethomeownersinsuranceinjacksonville\">When to Get Homeowners Insurance in Jacksonville</h2>\n<p>If you have a mortgage, your lender likely requires you to have homeowners insurance. Ideally, you should start pricing coverage as soon as you begin your house hunt so you can budget for your premium.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have a mortgage, it may be tempting to self insure and pay for damage to your home and belongings out of pocket. However, this can put you in a real financial bind if your home experiences a flood, hurricane, or fire. These types of damage can completely destroy a home.</p>\n<p>If you are considering homeowners insurance, be aware that you should purchase it before the start of hurricane season. Many insurers suspend selling home insurance right after a hurricane watch or warning has been issued for Florida.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchishomeownersinsuranceinjacksonville\">How Much Is Homeowners Insurance in Jacksonville?</h2>\n<p>The cost of Jacksonville homeowners insurance depends on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The exact location of your home</li>\n<li>The home’s condition and construction</li>\n<li>The amount of coverage you choose</li>\n<li>Your background (e.g., your credit-based insurance score and claims history)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That said, the median cost of homeowners insurance in Jacksonville, Florida is <strong>$1,191</strong>, according to our data.</p>\n<p>Take a look at our median premiums for the following Jacksonville ZIP codes to get an idea of what your neighbors might be paying for their coverage:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Jacksonville ZIP Code</th>\n<th>Median Premium</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>32277</td>\n<td>$983</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32266</td>\n<td>$1,034</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32259</td>\n<td>$1,216</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32258</td>\n<td>$1,137</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32257</td>\n<td>$1,033</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32256</td>\n<td>$869</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32254</td>\n<td>$1,034</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32250</td>\n<td>$2,019</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32246</td>\n<td>$1,029</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32233</td>\n<td>$1,066</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32226</td>\n<td>$1,761</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32225</td>\n<td>$2,096</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32224</td>\n<td>$1,345</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32223</td>\n<td>$1,260</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32219</td>\n<td>$1,027</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32211</td>\n<td>$1,174</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32210</td>\n<td>$1,148</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32209</td>\n<td>$1,170</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32205</td>\n<td>$1,193</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32204</td>\n<td>$1,238</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchhomeinsurancedojacksonvilleflhomeownersneed\">How Much Home Insurance Do Jacksonville, FL Homeowners Need?</h2>\n<p>The answer to this question is different for everyone. What’s most important to consider is how much you can actually afford to pay if your home is completely destroyed and what individual risks your home could realistically face.</p>\n<p>Homeowners often make the mistake of exclusively considering the purchase price of the home in determining how much insurance coverage they need. But what you paid for the house may not be what it costs to rebuild from the ground up after a fire or hurricane. This cost will include the construction materials and labor costs, which may be higher after an area-wide disaster.</p>\n<p>Insuring your home for the cost of rebuilding it at the current market rate is a responsible plan. This number may be higher than your purchase price because of stricter building codes, especially if your home was built before Hurricane Andrew. Replacement cost estimates are based on local construction costs and the square footage of your home. Kin is happy to crunch those numbers for you.</p>\n<p>Ready to check out your options? <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">Get a quote from Kin</a> and work with folks who understand Jacksonville’s unique home insurance needs.</p>"

    body: "<p>Miami, Florida, is iconic in the way few cities are. From the art galleries that pepper the Design District to the banyans adorning Coral Way, from the luxury condos in Brickell to the rich history of Buena Vista, the beach towns in Miami Beach, the culture of Little Havana, and the lush parks in Pinecrest, Miami has something to offer everyone but still feels like a best-kept secret. The homeowners here know that better than most.</p>\n<p>And they also know that living in Miami means contending with hurricanes, sinkholes, and flooding.

That’s why you should price your coverage as you shop for your home – it can help you anticipate how much to budget for home expenses.</p>\n<p>Also keep in mind that you usually can’t purchase homeowners insurance during a hurricane. Insurers usually suspend selling policies up to 24 hours before a hurricane and days after a hurricane has passed. If you need home insurance by a specific date, it’s better not to hesitate, especially if you are shopping for coverage during Florida’s hurricane season.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mediancostofmiamihomeownersinsurance\">Median Cost of Miami Homeowners Insurance</h2>\n<p>Our data shows the median cost of home insurance in Miami is $3,033. However, your premium will vary based on several factors, including your home’s location, wind mitigation systems, your claims history, and more.</p>\n<p>The premium information below is intended to give a rough idea of what home insurance in your area may cost.

That's because it may cost more than your home's purchase price to rebuild it from the ground up after a disaster once you factor in new but similar construction materials and current labor costs.</p>\n<p>But if your home is on valuable land, the opposite may be true. For example, waterfront property usually has a high purchase price because the location itself is so desirable. However, your insurance only covers the value of the home, not the land under it. So in this case, you might insure your home for less than what you paid for it, depending on the home's replacement cost.</p>\n<p>We get it – those are a lot of variables at play.

Located on the western coast of the state, it has low crime, wonderful outdoor activities, and amazing restaurants. Not only is there a lot to do in Naples, but it is one of the favorite places for celebrities such as Nicole Kidman and Chef Emeril Lagasse to holiday.</p>\n<p>Local residents do pay the price for living in such a great place. While Naples has a lower-than-average crime rate, it faces hurricanes, floods, and sinkholes every year. These risks make finding <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> challenging with many major carriers hiking up rates or pulling out of the region.</p>\n<p>The cost of homeowners insurance for Naples, Florida, varies widely by the carrier and by the type of home. But with Kin, a smaller home with wind mitigation may cost as little as $846 to insure. Kin's average cost of Naples homeowners insurance is $1,076 a year. You can also check if you qualify for a <a href=\"/blog/florida-homestead-exemption/\">Florida homestead exemption</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"napleshomeinsurancecosts\">Naples Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Florida is one of the most expensive states when it comes to insurance with a <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">national average price</a> of $1,951 a year (Oklahoma is the next highest with an average of $1,885). That said, what you pay for Florida coverage varies dramatically depending on the carrier. For example, Kin’s average home insurance premium in Florida is $1,354 a year.</p>\n<p>What impacts the cost of coverage in Florida? In short, Florida takes the brunt of hurricanes and tropical storms incoming from the Southern shores. The lowlands make flooding during moderate rains rampant and loosen the ground, leading to sinkholes.</p>\n<p>These perils are not unique to Florida, but their frequency certainly factors into the cost of Naples home insurance.</p>\n<p>Your home insurance quote is based on several factors, such as your home’s size, age, type of construction, and geographic region (where its proximity to shorelines and other known hazard zones can impact price considerably).</p>\n<p>Comparing the cost of homeowners insurance in Naples (part of Collier County), you can see the costs vary widely between Kin and other insurance companies.</p>\n<p>| Average Naples Home Insurance Premiums by Carrier x Home Value |</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Value of Home</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Security First</th>\n<th>Universal Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company</th>\n<th>Tower Hill Preferred</th>\n<th>State Farm</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction, No Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$1,279</td>\n<td>$3,515</td>\n<td>$4,447</td>\n<td>$3,431</td>\n<td>$4,533</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction w/ Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$846</td>\n<td>$1,899</td>\n<td>$1,849</td>\n<td>$1,618</td>\n<td>$2,580</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> New Construction</td>\n<td>$1,103</td>\n<td>$3,679</td>\n<td>$3,701</td>\n<td>$2,788</td>\n<td>$4,801</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Notice that a home double in size doesn’t necessarily mean that you will pay double the insurance rate. The <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a> of structure is a significant factor in how insurance policies are priced. In other words, because it takes more materials to rebuild a bigger home than a smaller home, bigger homes are also more expensive to insure in the same area.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the home’s construction plays a role in its insurance cost. For example, laminate floors are less expensive to replace than maple hardwood floors. Cherrywood cabinets are more expensive to replace than pressed-wood cabinets. Any intricate, unique feature will also increase your home’s replacement cost, as will the grade of lumber.</p>\n<p>That’s why getting a tailored quote is so important – you want your coverage to protect your Naples home and account for its unique traits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"basicsofnapleshomeinsurance\">Basics of Naples Home Insurance</h2>\n<p>When <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">buying homeowners insurance</a> in Naples, Florida, you want a policy that includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost dwelling coverage</strong>: The amount it costs to rebuild the structure of your home to it’s pre-claim condition.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal property coverage</strong>: The total value of personal belongings, including clothing, electronics, appliances, and home goods.</li>\n<li><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong>: A provision that pays for you to stay in a hotel or rent a place while your home undergoes repairs during a covered claim.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong>: Covers you for third-party claims against you, such as your dog biting a neighbor or your tree falling and damaging a neighbor’s property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While these are the most important coverages, they aren’t the only ones available. Talk to a Kin representative about your home to learn how much coverage you need and what <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a> might make sense for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coveringspecificrisksinnaplesflorida\">Covering Specific Risks in Naples, Florida</h2>\n<p>Kin’s standard home insurance for Naples offers <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">all-perils coverage</a> for the home. In other words, it covers a lot of losses, including fire, theft, and water damage from burst pipes. It also includes coverage for hurricane winds, but flood coverage must be added on.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at some of Naples’ biggest risks and how insurance addresses them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"napleshurricanecoverage\">Naples Hurricane Coverage</h3>\n<p>Naples is a coastal community sitting on the Gulf of Mexico in Florida. When Hurricane Irma hit the region in 2017, Naples considered itself “lucky,” despite suffering significant flooding and structural damage.</p>\n<p>Without <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a> during Irma, some folks were left without a home and no means to rebuild. Hurricane insurance specifically covers any wind-related damage to your home that happens during the extreme winds of the powerful storm. When you make a hurricane-related claim, your separate <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> applies. This is often a flat amount ($500) or a percentage of the home’s replacement cost (2 percent, 5 percent, or 10 percent).</p>\n<h3 id=\"naplesfloodinsurance\">Naples Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>Naples sits in a high-risk area for flood damage. But according to the <a href=\"https://www.naplesgov.com/building/page/flood-zone-maps\">city of Naples</a>, the city has taken measures to reduce the impact of potential floods and is now rated a Class 5 city by FEMA. However, even with preventative measures, a city can still flood. Even an inch of water can cost thousands of dollars of damage to your home.</p>\n<p>A standard home insurance policy won’t cover flooding (even due to a hurricane). Because Naples is flanked by the western coast and many inlets to the east of the city, it is susceptible to storm surge flooding. Flood insurance covers anything considered “rising water.”</p>\n<p>So while the burst pipe in your house is covered by homeowners insurance, the storm surge from Hurricane Irma was covered only for those who had flood insurance. The Kin <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood endorsement</a> is designed to cover events such as these.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sinkholecoverageinnaples\">Sinkhole Coverage in Naples</h3>\n<p>Naples is not a high-risk Florida community for sinkholes, but the entire state sits on limestone deposits. As limestone gets wet, it softens, leading to massive sinkholes throughout the state. If you are concerned about sinkhole risks in your area, speak with a Kin representative about <a href=\"/glossary/sinkhole-insurance/\">sinkhole and catastrophic ground collapse coverage</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/home%20insurance%20discounts%202.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforloweringnapleshomeownersinsurancecosts\">Tips for Lowering Naples Homeowners Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Even the safest communities have risks that impact insurance costs. If you are concerned about high homeowners insurance premiums, ask about these discounts to help save money:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Protective devices</strong>: Think smoke alarms, security systems, and water mitigation devices.</li>\n<li><strong>Wind mitigation measures</strong>: Impact resistant doors and windows and reinforced roofing can help you save considerably.</li>\n<li><strong>Secure communities</strong>: These are gated communities with or without guards.</li>\n<li><strong>New construction</strong>: Homes built after 2001 have more wind-resistant construction.</li>\n<li><strong>Electronic policy</strong>: Cut the paper and opt to manage your account digitally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once your home is properly insured, the best way to keep costs down is to have a positive claims history. The fewer claims you have, the less expensive your insurance will be.</p>\n<p>Get a tailored quote from Kin, and our representatives will look for every discount and help you understand what affects the price of your policy.</p>"

    body: "<p>Orlando, Florida, beloved home of Disney World, Universal Studios, SeaWorld, and the Kennedy Space Center, is unsurprisingly a great place to live. From the exceptional dining in 50 Mills District near Park Lake Highland to the historic downtown of Winter Garden, Orlando has something to offer everyone. That might explain why <strong>277,173</strong> people call this city home.</p>\n<p>But the same features that make Orlando an attractive place to plant roots also make the city prone to risks that impact your home insurance needs. For example, West Orlando’s flat and low terrain and its proximity to swamps and Lake Apoka make it flood prone. In East Orlando, homes in Delaney Park and Lake Davis and near the Econlockhatchee River are prone to flood risk, too.</p>\n<p>And don’t forget about those <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2013/08/12/us/florida-resort-sinkhole/index.html\">resort-gobbling sinkholes</a>, either.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at how you can make sure your <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> addresses the risks that come with living in Orlando, Florida.</p>\n<h2 id=\"findinghomeinsuranceinorlandoflorida\">Finding Home Insurance in Orlando, Florida</h2>\n<p>A standard homeowners insurance policy will offer coverage any home, regardless of its location, usually needs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replacement-cost coverage for both the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">house</a> and the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal belongings</a> within.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Coverage for structures</a> like garages, fences, sheds, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Additional living expenses</a> in case the home is uninhabitable after a covered event.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal liability coverage</a> for injuries or property damage the homeowner causes others.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical payments coverage</a> to pay for an injured visitor’s immediate medical expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But owning a home in Orlando means you’ll also want to understand your <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a> and consider flood and sinkhole insurance (excluded from a standard homeowners policy).</p>\n<h3 id=\"orlandohurricanedeductibleswindmitigationdiscounts\">Orlando Hurricane Deductibles &amp; Wind Mitigation Discounts</h3>\n<p>Florida home insurance policies have two separate deductibles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The standard home insurance deductible</strong>, which applies when you make a claim over fire, non-hurricane wind, theft, and vandalism damage.</li>\n<li><strong>A hurricane deductible</strong>, which applies when you make a claim over hurricane-level wind damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can choose your hurricane deductible, though most policies default the deductible at two percent of your home coverage (this is true for Kin). So if you have $300,000 in dwelling insurance, your two percent hurricane deductible would be $6,000. You can increase your deductible up to 10 percent, which will lower your monthly premiums. However, that means you will pay more out of pocket when you need to make a claim for hurricane wind damage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/orlandoDeductibleVsPremium.png?width=600&name=orlandoDeductibleVsPremium.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Another way to save money is to make wind mitigation improvements to your home. Florida requires home insurance companies to offer insurance discounts for homes that are hurricane resistant.</p>\n<p>If your home was built before the Hurricane Andrew building codes took effect (prior to 2001), you may want to reinforce your roof and install impact-resistant windows to qualify for cheaper home insurance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"orlandofloodinsurance\">Orlando Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>Though you aren’t legally required to have <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> for your Orlando home and Orlando isn’t along the coast, it is surrounded by lakes, swamps, and other bodies of water that might cause flooding. Take, for example, nearby <a href=\"https://www.clickorlando.com/news/flooding-shuts-down-problem-area-on-orlando-avenue-in-maitland-again\">Maitland which is struggling</a> to maintain sufficient storm water drainage to nearby lakes.</p>\n<p>Even if Orlando has been historically safe from some of this flooding, the fact is that hurricanes are becoming more frequent and it’s difficult to predict which locations will be spared the resulting flood damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"oneinchofstandingwaterinsideaonestoryhomecausesd23635indamage\">\"One inch of standing water inside a one-story home causes $23,635 in damage.\"</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/Flood-Repair-Costs.png?width=600&name=Flood-Repair-Costs.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>It’s also worth considering that standard home insurance doesn’t offer coverage for flood damage caused by storm surges. What’s more, even one inch of standing water inside an average one-story home <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1499290622913-0bcd74f47bf20aa94998a5a920837710/Flood_Loss_Estimations_2017.pdf\">costs $23,635 in repairs</a>. If that’s not a price you can comfortably afford out of pocket, you may want to talk to a Kin representative about purchasing flood insurance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"orlandosinkholeinsurance\">Orlando Sinkhole Insurance</h3>\n<p>Orlando, like other parts of Florida, is susceptible to sinkholes, which form in conditions where aquifer levels change drastically. High volumes of water dissolve the limestone underneath the surface, but when the water disappears, it leaves unsupported caverns that collapse, causing a sinkhole. These can be extremely expensive for homeowners to manage on their own.</p>\n<p>The<a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/UserContent/Session/2011/Publications/InterimReports/pdf/2011-104bi.pdf\"> Florida Senate Committee on Banking and Insurance</a> reported insurers received more than 24,000 sinkhole damage claims between 2006 and 2010, an average of 17 a day.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/orlandoSinkholes.png?width=600&name=orlandoSinkholes.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Florida law requires insurers to provide catastrophic ground cover collapse coverage, which can cover losses resulting from certain types of geological activity. Sinkhole losses may be covered if all the following conditions are met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There's an “abrupt” collapse of ground cover</li>\n<li>The depression in the ground cover is clearly visible</li>\n<li>The home and its foundation sustain structural damage</li>\n<li>A government entity condemns the structure and orders it to be vacated</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whentogetorlandohomeownersinsurance\">When to Get Orlando Homeowners Insurance</h2>\n<p>The only time it’s too late to get insurance is when a tropical storm or hurricane watch or warning has been issued for <em>any</em> area in Florida. Insurance companies control how long that bind suspension lasts – sometimes it’s days before and after a storm has passed.

That's usually true if you've made upgrades to the home, if you must comply with new building codes during repairs (worth noting if your house was built before 2001), or if the cost of construction and building materials drastically spike after a widespread disaster.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you should insure your home for what it would cost to rebuild it at current market prices.

The moniker is a nod to its history under Spanish, French, British, Confederate, and American rule. Fittingly, the city’s claim to fame is being the oldest European settlement in the US.</p>\n<p>Residents in the city deal with another kind of history: the region’s nearly 110 rainy days per year with an average precipitation rate of 65 inches each year. The area’s risk of flooding can make it challenging to find affordable <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> in Pensacola. Luckily, Kin’s rates average just $1,222 a year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pensacolahomeinsurancecosts\">Pensacola Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Florida is one of the most expensive states for home insurance because of its hurricane exposure. Among all carriers, the state’s average premium is $1,951 whereas the average cost of Kin’s Florida policies is $1,354 a year.</p>\n<p>In other words: where you get your coverage plays a significant role in how much you pay for coverage. Take a look at how homeowners insurance rates vary in Pensacola (part of Escambia County) between Kin Insurance and other carriers.</p>\n<p>| Average Pensacola Home Insurance Premiums by Carrier x Home Value |</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Value of Home</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Security First</th>\n<th>Universal Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company</th>\n<th>Tower Hill Preferred</th>\n<th>State Farm</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction, No Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$1,338</td>\n<td>$3,031</td>\n<td>$2,984</td>\n<td>$3,343</td>\n<td>$3,483</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction w/ Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$1,004</td>\n<td>$1,649</td>\n<td>$1,312</td>\n<td>$1,772</td>\n<td>$2,223</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> New Construction</td>\n<td>$1,323</td>\n<td>$3,221</td>\n<td>$2,583</td>\n<td>$3,152</td>\n<td>$3,934</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The cost of your coverage varies depending on where you live (and other factors, like the value of your home and its age), so it’s helpful to look at average costs for your county.

The only way to truly know how much you’ll pay for coverage is to <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">get a quote</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting how your home’s value and its construction impact your premium.

At its most basic, a good policy will offer the following types of coverage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: This is how much you have to rebuild your home to its pre-claim condition.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: This helps you repair or rebuild other structures on your property, such as your garage, shed, etc.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: This is the total value of your personal belongings, such as clothing, electronics, appliances, your vinyl collection, etc.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: This can help you pay for additional living expenses, like staying in a hotel, while your home is under repair for a covered claim.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: This is how much your provider will pay toward a claim that you damaged someone’s property.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: This is how much your provider will cover for “friendly injuries” on your property – i.e., someone needs medical attention but isn’t likely to sue you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may have coverage needs beyond these basics, which is why it’s important to work with an insurer who understands your home’s unique risks. Kin representatives are trained to help you get just the right amount of coverage – not too much, not too little.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coveringpensacolafloridasbigrisks\">Covering Pensacola, Florida’s Big Risks</h2>\n<p>While homeowners insurance in Pensacola covers a variety of risks, such as fire, wind damage, vandalism, theft, and more, it’s smart to get acquainted with how your policy addresses natural disasters. Let’s take a look.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pensacolahurricanecoverage\">Pensacola Hurricane Coverage</h3>\n<p>This part of the Florida Panhandle is often impacted by hurricanes but not directly hit. In 2004, two hurricanes hit as Category 2 and Category 3 storms: Frances and Ivan, respectively. Hurricane season begins June 1 and ends November 30, leaving a lot of time every year for storms to brew and have a direct or indirect impact on Pensacola.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">Hurricane home insurance</a> pays for damage to your home, belongings, and other structures resulting from the high winds of the storm. All Kin policies include hurricane coverage – you just need to choose your hurricane deductible (a $500 flat fee or 2 percent, 5 percent, or 10 percent of your home’s replacement cost).</p>\n<h3 id=\"pensacolafloodinsurance\">Pensacola Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>Pensacola is extremely prone to flooding. As Mayor Robinson expressed in a 2019 <a href=\"https://weartv.com/news/local/pensacola-mayor-says-flooding-problems-unacceptable\">WARETV news report</a>, “We’re stuck with drainage problems and we have no money.” What this means for Pensacola residents is you are likely to experience a flood from heavy rains and hurricanes, and the city is not prepared to mitigate the risk.</p>\n<p>Most flood insurance is written through the National Flood Insurance Program, which is often limited in its coverage. Kin Insurance offers it owns <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood endorsement</a>, a cost-effective solution with higher limits and no waiting period to get covered.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sinkholecoverageinpensacola\">Sinkhole Coverage in Pensacola</h3>\n<p>Sinkholes happen in every part of Florida due to the high concentration of limestone in the ground, and Pensacola is no exception. Heavy limestone deposits make the ground susceptible to collapse once water erodes the limestone.</p>\n<p>Kin’s <a href=\"/glossary/sinkhole-insurance/\">sinkhole coverage</a> helps protect residents in high-risk areas. It can cover sinkhole damage to your home, such as foundation displacement and buckling walls.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/home%20insurance%20discounts%202.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforloweringpensacolahomeinsurancecosts\">Tips for Lowering Pensacola Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Even with a low-cost policy, it’s smart to look for additional ways to save on your Pensacola homeowners insurance. For example, ask about <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Protective devices</strong>, like security and fire alarms.</li>\n<li><strong>Wind mitigation measures</strong>, such as reinforced roofing.</li>\n<li><strong>Gated communities</strong>, with or without guards.</li>\n<li><strong>New construction</strong>, if your home is less than six years old.</li>\n<li><strong>Electronic policy</strong>, i.e., the ability to manage your account fully online.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ll proactively check your eligibility for all available discounts, but be sure to have your <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">wind mitigation inspection</a> ready!

Most residents own their homes, and the school districts are highly rated. While the cost of living in Sarasota is about nine percent higher than the Florida average, the trade-off is a small-town feel with all a big city offers.</p>\n<p>When comparing prices of homeowners insurance, Sarasota is less expensive than many other Florida cities – about $827 on average for Kin policyholders. While Sarasota is less prone to hurricanes than other southern and eastern beach cities, it still faces flood risk.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at how to find affordable <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> for your Sarasota home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sarasotahomeinsurancecosts\">Sarasota Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Sarasota home insurance costs less than the Florida <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">average of $1,951 annually</a> (from all carriers) and the Kin average of $1,354 a year.</p>\n<p>Every home is different, which means every insurance policy is different, too. Any <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a> added to the policy will ultimately impact your costs. For example, flood insurance can be added to policies, as can <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">animal liability coverage</a>.</p>\n<p>The costs below illustrate average homeowners insurance costs in Sarasota (part of Sarasota County) between Kin and other insurance companies. These costs are meant to be illustrative only and are based on a standard policy (no extras).</p>\n<p>| Average Sarasota Home Insurance Premiums by Carrier x Home Value |</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Value of Home</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Security First</th>\n<th>Universal Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company</th>\n<th>Tower Hill Preferred</th>\n<th>State Farm</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction, No Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$968</td>\n<td>$2,479</td>\n<td>$2,928</td>\n<td>$2,739</td>\n<td>$3,370</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction w/ Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$668</td>\n<td>$1,378</td>\n<td>$1,330</td>\n<td>$1,372</td>\n<td>$2,078</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> New Construction</td>\n<td>$846</td>\n<td>$2,602</td>\n<td>$2,598</td>\n<td>$2,445</td>\n<td>$3,782</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Every home is built differently. Your Kin quote will consider the size, age, and construction materials used in making your home. For older homes, you can see that investing in wind mitigation features, such as a reinforced roof, can potentially save you hundreds of dollars every year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sarasotahomeinsurancebasics\">Sarasota Home Insurance Basics</h2>\n<p>A basic home insurance policy still offers robust protection. When buying <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a>, whether your in Sarasota or elsewhere, make sure yours includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost coverage</strong>: This is the total cost to rebuild your home from the foundation up after a covered loss.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal property coverage</strong>: This helps you replace or repair your belongings after a covered incident.</li>\n<li><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong>: When a covered claim forces you to temporarily relocate while your home is under repair, this can help you cover extra living expenses.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal liability</strong> <strong>coverage</strong>: This helps pay for settlements when someone sues you for damage or bodily harm you caused.</li>\n<li><strong>Medical payments</strong>: This is intended to cover small visitor injuries that happen on your property and help avoid lawsuits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your policy can easily be customized to meet your needs. Ask your Kin representative if additional coverages, like flood insurance, animal liability insurance, or <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduled property insurance</a> makes sense for you. You should also check if you are eligible for <a href=\"/blog/florida-homestead-exemption/\">Florida Homestead Exemption</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coveringspecificrisksinsarasotaflorida\">Covering Specific Risks in Sarasota, Florida</h2>\n<p>Home insurance can cover losses from fire, wind, vandalism, and theft, which is a good thing considering Sarasota has one of the <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/fl/sarasota/crime\">highest crime rates</a> in the state. Here are some other special coverage situations to keep in mind as you shop for coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sarasotahurricanecoverage\">Sarasota Hurricane Coverage</h3>\n<p>Sarasota is vulnerable to storms from the Gulf of Mexico because of its location on the central western shore of Florida. While October usually sees the most hurricane activity, <a href=\"/insurance-resources/hurricane-updates/\">hurricane season</a> starts in June and ends in November. Sarasota and surrounding towns tend to avoid direct hits from storms like Hurricane Irma because the storms usually land south of the city and travel east.</p>\n<p>Even though Sarasota has been lucky in recent years, it still feels the effects of the storm. <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">Hurricane insurance</a> pays for claims resulting from the high winds of the storm. That’s why <a href=\"/glossary/wind-mitigation/\">wind mitigation measures</a> help reduce your insurance rate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sarasotafloodinsurance\">Sarasota Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>Many Sarasota homeowners may be required to have flood insurance by their mortgage lenders. The barrier islands, shoreline, and homes along the canal have the highest risk of flooding.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t take much water for thousands of dollars of damage to be done. Even an inch of water can be disastrous for structures and personal property. Luckily, the <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">Kin Insurance flood endorsement</a> doesn’t have the same coverage restrictions and limits as NFIP policies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sinkholecoverageinsarasota\">Sinkhole Coverage in Sarasota</h3>\n<p>Aside from flooding and hurricane threats, Sarasota is home to a giant sinkhole called the Myakka Deep Hole, a popular but benign tourist attraction.</p>\n<p>Even though the eastern part of the state tends to have more sinkholes, Sarasota has its fair share. Geologists claim the sinkholes in the state are the result of heavy limestone concentrations that collapse when soaked and eroded over time.</p>\n<p>Sarasota residents who are concerned about sinkhole threats should be aware that Kin policies include <a href=\"/glossary/sinkhole-insurance/\">catastrophic ground cover collapse coverage</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/home%20insurance%20discounts%202.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforloweringsarasotahomeownersinsurancecosts\">Tips for Lowering Sarasota Homeowners Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Keeping costs down is important for any homeowner.

Certified wind mitigation features can reduce an annual insurance premium on a $150,000 Sarasota home policy by $300, according to our data. That’s one-third the policy premium.</p>\n<p>Your Kin representative will review all discount opportunities and make sure you get reliable coverage at an affordable price.

Like most of the state, St. Petersburg is prone to hurricanes, flooding, and sinkholes, which can drive up the cost of <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>Luckily, Kin policyholders only pay an average of $1,206 each year for home insurance in St. Petersburg.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stpetersburghomeinsurancecosts\">St. Petersburg Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Homeowners insurance in Florida</a> consistently ranks among the most expensive in the US, which is why Kin constantly innovates to keep rates low. And it shows: our customers in St. Petersburg pay $1,206 a year on average for their coverage.</p>\n<p>Compare that to the average premiums of other home insurance providers in St. Petersburg below.

Your Kin Insurance representative will walk you through your available discounts when you <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">apply for a quote.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"basicsofstpetersburghomeinsurance\">Basics of St. Petersburg Home Insurance</h2>\n<p>If you’re <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">buying homeowners insurance</a> in St. Petersburg, Florida, you’ll likely want an <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3</a> policy, which means you’ll get the following basic protections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: This helps you rebuild your home after a covered claim.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: This protects other structures on your property that aren’t your dwelling, like your shed, garage, barn, etc.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: This covers your personal belongings in the home, such as your furniture, clothing, appliances, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: When a covered claim forces you to temporarily relocate, this can help pay for additional expenses, such as hotel stays, takeout, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: This kicks in when you’re sued over injuries or property damage you cause.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: This pays for small medical bills when visitors are hurt on your property in the hope of deterring a more expensive lawsuit later.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your Kin representative can customize your policy with additional <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a> to meet your specific needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coveringstpetersburgsbigrisks\">Covering St. Petersburg’s Big Risks</h2>\n<p>Your policy covers the usual perils – think fire, wind damage, vandalism and theft (which is a good thing considering St. Petersburg’s crime rate is <a href=\"https://www.city-data.com/crime/crime-St.-Petersburg-Florida.html\">1.2 times higher</a> than the national average). But it’s important to understand how your policy addresses catastrophes, too. Let’s look at three big risks in particular.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stpetersburghurricanecoverage\">St. Petersburg Hurricane Coverage</h3>\n<p>St. Petersburg is not historically prone to direct hurricane contact. The city is a little luckier than southern or eastern coastline cities because most storms hit landmass and start to die down before reaching St. Petersburg. That said, the city has about a 10 percent chance of getting hit by a hurricane every year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">Hurricane insurance</a>, included in all Kin policies, pays for damage caused by hurricane winds. When you make a hurricane claim, your hurricane deductible applies. This is a flat $500 fee or 2 percent, 5 percent, or 10 percent of your home’s dwelling coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stpetersburgfloodinsurance\">St. Petersburg Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>With the exception of its northern border, St. Petersburg is surrounded by the shores of Tampa Bay. Coupled with its proximity to coastlines, many interior waterways, and poor drainage, homeowners here face a lot of flood risk.</p>\n<p>Though many homeowners think hurricane insurance covers the storm surge associated with hurricanes and tropical storms, it doesn’t. Only <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> will cover damage from “rising waters.” Ask your Kin representative to add flood coverage to your policy – it’s more affordable than you may think.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sinkholecoverageinstpetersburg\">Sinkhole Coverage in St. Petersburg</h3>\n<p>St. Petersburg is considered part of “sinkhole alley,” a nickname for the area where dozens of homeowners face sinkhole risk. Without the appropriate coverage, homeowners must pay out of pocket to repair structural issues caused by sinkholes, including foundation cracks, collapse, uneven floors, and buckling walls. Talk to your Kin representative about adding the <a href=\"/glossary/sinkhole-insurance/\">sinkhole coverage</a> to your policy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/home%20insurance%20discounts%202.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforkeepingstpetersburghomeinsurancecostsdown\">Tips for Keeping St. Petersburg Home Insurance Costs Down</h2>\n<p>The best way to <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">save on your home insurance</a> is to take steps to make your home safer. When you do, you may be eligible for <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Installing protective devices.</li>\n<li>Having strong wind mitigation measures in place.</li>\n<li>Living in a secure community.</li>\n<li>Having a home less than six years old.</li>\n<li>Signing up for an electronic policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another way to save? Try to avoid making small claims on your home insurance policy. If you can handle a small repair on your own, you’ll help keep your premium low in the long run.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about getting insured in St. Petersburg, call us at <a href=\"tel:855-717-0022\">855-717-0022</a>.</p>"

But you don’t have to be a science buff to appreciate living in Tallahassee. With a vibrant urban community, parks and gardens, and outdoor activities, there’s something for everyone.</p>\n<p>Yet homeowners here face nearly 60 inches of rainfall every year, meaning flooding is a real risk. Those seeking affordable <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a> can find it through Kin where our average rate in Tallahassee is $974 a year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tallahasseehomeinsurancecosts\">Tallahassee Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>The average homeowners insurance rate in Florida for all carriers combined is $1,951, making Florida one of the most expensive states for homeowners insurance. Kin is considerably more affordable with an average state-wide premium of $1,354 a year. In fact, homeowners in Tallahassee can get a policy that covers both standard perils and hurricanes for as little as $875 annually.</p>\n<p>That said, your policy’s price depends on the age, construction, size, and exact location of your home. Your personal property coverage and liability limits also impact the cost of your coverage.</p>\n<p>Comparing the cost of homeowners insurance in Tallahassee (part of Leon County), you see the costs vary widely between Kin and other insurance companies.</p>\n<p>| Average Tallahassee Home Insurance Premiums by Carrier x Home Value |</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Value of Home</th>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Security First</th>\n<th>Universal Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company</th>\n<th>Tower Hill Preferred</th>\n<th>State Farm</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction, No Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$929</td>\n<td>$1,171</td>\n<td>$983</td>\n<td>$1,357</td>\n<td>$1,856</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$150k</span>, Pre-2001 Construction w/ Wind Mit</td>\n<td>$875</td>\n<td>$1,063</td>\n<td>$579</td>\n<td>$934</td>\n<td>$1,574</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span data-a11y-number>$300k</span> New Construction</td>\n<td>$1,118</td>\n<td>$1,371</td>\n<td>$1,068</td>\n<td>$1,653</td>\n<td>$2,650</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The chart shows that Kin is competitively priced. The rates also illustrate the savings policyholders experience when buying a newly built home or installing wind mitigation features.</p>\n<p>A newer home may be considerably cheaper to insure because new homes are built to meet stricter building codes to better withstand hurricanes. As you can see, a new home that is twice the value is just $200 more a year to insure.</p>\n<p>If your home has special features – like a swimming pool or <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">hurricane screen enclosure</a> – talk to your Kin representative and we can help you protect them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"basicsoftallahasseehomeinsurance\">Basics of Tallahassee Home Insurance</h2>\n<p>If you’ve ever looked at your insurance policy’s declarations page and wondered what it all means, you’re not alone. Insurance has a reputation for being complicated, so let’s keep it simple.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">buying homeowners insurance</a> in Tallahassee, Florida, pay attention to the following on your declarations page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: This is how much you have to rebuild your home to its pre-claim condition.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: This helps you repair or rebuild other structures on your property, such as your garage, shed, etc.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property insurance</strong></a>: This is the total value of your personal belongings, such as clothing, electronics, appliances, your vinyl collection, etc.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: This can help you pay for additional living expenses, like staying in a hotel, while your home is under repair for a covered claim.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: This is how much your provider will pay toward a claim that you damaged someone’s property.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: This is how much your provider will cover for “friendly injuries” on your property – i.e., someone needs medical attention but isn’t likely to sue you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, depending on your home and your needs, your policy may include additional coverages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coveringbigrisksintallahasseeflorida\">Covering Big Risks in Tallahassee, Florida</h2>\n<p>Tallahassee home insurance policies cover standard perils, such as fire, theft, and water damage caused by a pipe bursting. In Florida, we talk a lot about hurricanes and flooding, but crime in Tallahassee is high, too. Make sure you are covered for natural disasters and that your personal property is adequately covered for theft.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tallahasseehurricanecoverage\">Tallahassee Hurricane Coverage</h3>\n<p>While storms that move up the eastern coast can hit Tallahassee, its biggest risk is from storms like Hurricane Michael that move northeast from the Florida Panhandle. Though many storms that make landfall to the east or south generally die down before reaching Tallahassee, the region is still prone to storms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">Hurricane insurance</a> pays for the damage caused by the high winds of a hurricane. The winds can destroy roofs or send tree branches and other debris through homes, causing thousands of dollars in damages. Kin policies include hurricane insurance, and homeowners can choose a hurricane deductible of $500 or 2 percent, 5 percent, or 10 percent of the home’s replacement cost. This is separate from your <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">standard home insurance deductible</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tallahasseefloodinsurance\">Tallahassee Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>There are four main waterways that cause flooding in Tallahassee: the West Drainage Ditch, the East Drainage Ditch, the Central Drainage Ditch, and the Northeast Drainage Ditch. This doesn’t mean other areas of the city are without flood risk, but these areas can be especially risky during heavy rains.</p>\n<p>Flooding in these areas is often just inches deep but can flood garages, basements, and street-level floors. Kin Insurance offers a <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood endorsement</a> to help homeowners deal with this type of risk and save money on flood coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sinkholecoverageintallahassee\">Sinkhole Coverage in Tallahassee</h3>\n<p>Sinkholes can happen in any part of Florida due to the high concentration of limestone in the ground, but the <a href=\"https://sinkholemaps.com/resources/tallahassee-sinkholes-what-you-should-know-before-moving-to-tallahassee-fl/\">middle of Tallahassee</a> is especially susceptible to sinkholes. The swamplands erode limestone in the ground and lead to collapse.</p>\n<p>Sinkholes aren’t just in the remote part of the city; in 2014 and 2018 respectively, two sinkholes appeared in residents’ yards. Luckily, no one was hurt. Kin’s coverage for <a href=\"/glossary/sinkhole-insurance/\">sinkholes</a> helps protect residents in areas where ground collapse is more common.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/home%20insurance%20discounts%202.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforkeepingtallahasseehomeinsurancecostsdown\">Tips for Keeping Tallahassee Home Insurance Costs Down</h2>\n<p>Even though Tallahassee home insurance is some of the least expensive homeowners insurance in the state, there are still things you can do to keep costs down. Saving even $300 every year adds up to thousands over the life of your mortgage.</p>\n<p>The following <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> are available for homeowners in Tallahassee:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Protective devices</strong>: Smoke alarms, security systems, and water mitigation systems</li>\n<li><strong>Wind mitigation measures</strong>: Impact-resistant doors and windows and reinforced roofing</li>\n<li><strong>Secure communities</strong>: Gated neighborhoods with or without guards</li>\n<li><strong>New construction</strong>: Homes under six years of age</li>\n<li><strong>Electronic policy</strong>: Online policy and account management</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your Kin representative will review these discounts to make sure you get every opportunity to save. Some discounts require documentation, so be prepared with your <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">wind mitigation inspection report</a> and <a href=\"/faq/what-is-a-central-alarm/\">security certificate</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p>You don’t need us to tell you that Tampa, Florida, is <a href=\"https://realestate.usnews.com/places/florida/tampa\">one of the best places to live</a>. From the bustling business district in downtown Tampa to the scenic waterfront of Bayshore Boulevard to the boutiques and restaurants in Ybor City, Tampa has plenty to offer the 377,165 folks who call this city home. Maybe that’s why Tampa was rated the <a href=\"http://www.worldpropertyjournal.com/real-estate-news/united-states/tampa-real-estate-news/zillow-2018-best-markets-for-first-time-buyers-analysis-best-cities-for-first-time-home-buyers-in-2018-tampa-real-estate-news-orlando-real-estate-news-10786.php\">best market in the United States for first-time homebuyers</a> in 2018.</p>\n<p>But the charms that make Tampa so alluring also bring unique risks for the homes located here. Let’s review when you need homeowners insurance in Tampa and the home coverage that keeps you protected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"areyourequiredtohavehomeownersinsuranceintampafl\">Are You Required to Have Homeowners Insurance in Tampa, FL?</h2>\n<p>Yes, if you have a mortgage, your lender will usually require you to have <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re shopping for homes during hurricane season or thinking about switching providers, it’s important to understand most insurers will not sell home insurance once a potential storm watch or warning has been issued anywhere in Florida. The duration of that suspension is dependent on the company. That's something to keep if you are working within a time-sensitive framework, like closing on a house. Exceptions can be made for previously scheduled closings, but it's still smart to plan ahead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whathomeinsuranceshouldtampahomeownersconsider\">What Home Insurance Should Tampa Homeowners Consider?</h2>\n<p>Now that you know you need home insurance, let’s consider what kind of home protection makes sense.</p>\n<p>A quality homeowners insurance policy will offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replacement-cost coverage for both the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling</a> and your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal belongings</a>.</li>\n<li>Protection for <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">other structures</a>, such as garages, fences, sheds, and more.</li>\n<li>Coverage for <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">additional living expenses</a> if you can’t use your home after a covered event.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal liability coverage</a> in case your dog bites someone or a visitor is injured in your home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical expenses coverage</a> to pay for an injured visitor’s immediate medical expenses (and hopefully avoid a lawsuit!).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are basic protections for any home. But owning a house in Tampa means you may need to consider other coverages to address floods and sinkholes. Plus, you may want to take certain precautions to take advantage of wind mitigation insurance discounts, which insurance companies are legally required to offer. Let’s look at these in more detail.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodinsurancetampascoastalproximity\">Flood Insurance &amp; Tampa’s Coastal Proximity</h3>\n<p>Tampa’s proximity water leaves its inhabitants naturally vulnerable to hurricanes and coast-related flooding. Even tidal flooding can be a <a href=\"https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/king-tide-floods-tampa-bay-coast\">considerable issue in Tampa</a>, which already suffers from drainage problems. In the 2017, some areas of Tampa saw as much as four feet of water because of tidal flooding. Tampa’s lack of topographic relief exacerbates its draining issues, especially during the rainy season – the water simply has nowhere to go.</p>\n<p>Storm surges are also a concern for Tampa residents. These were a major threat during Hurricane Irma and the rising sea levels around the bay only contribute to this problem. In the last 20 years, sea levels have increased from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/health/environment/tampa-bay-climate-change/?utm_term=.9116316087f0\">one inch per decade to several inches</a>. By 2050, predictions state the bay will rise between six inches and two feet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tampahaslittleinthewayofcoastaldefensestoblockwatersfromsweepingupandcoveringthecityvoxhttpswwwvoxcomscienceandhealth201791016283382hurricaneirmastormsurgetampanaplesflorida\">“[Tampa] has little in the way of coastal defenses to block waters from sweeping up and covering the city.” – <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/9/10/16283382/hurricane-irma-storm-surge-tampa-naples-florida\">Vox</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/tampaFloodrisk.png?width=600&name=tampaFloodrisk.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Considering these factors, it’s easy to see why, according to the Washington Post, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/national/harvey-flood-compare/?utm_term=.14660468c87a\">Tampa Bay is the most vulnerable area in the United States</a> to flood and hurricane damage.</p>\n<p>In other words, it’s extremely risky for Tampa homeowners to forgo <a href=\"/flood-insurance\">flood insurance</a>. A Kin representative can help you get the appropriate coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sinkholecoverage\">Sinkhole Coverage</h3>\n<p>Because of its susceptibility to flooding, Tampa is also at risk for sinkholes.</p>\n<p>The majority of Florida rests on limestone, which soaks up water during the rainy season. Water wears down this bedrock, and as the climate gets drier, the pocket formed is filled with water and no other means of support. Just like that, a sinkhole is formed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/tampaSinkholeFormation.png?width=600&name=tampaSinkholeFormation.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Sinkholes are extremely expensive for homeowners, usually hundreds of thousands of dollars for a single incident. The bad news? They are also increasingly common. Florida alone experiences <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/UserContent/Session/2011/Publications/InterimReports/pdf/2011-104bi.pdf\">more than 17 sinkholes per day</a>.</p>\n<p>Catastrophic ground cover collapse coverage is included in your policy and can help cover total losses caused by sinkholes. Ask a Kin agent for more details.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/tampaSinkHoles.png?width=600&name=tampaSinkHoles.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"hurricanedeductibleswindmitigationdiscounts\">Hurricane Deductibles &amp; Wind Mitigation Discounts</h3>\n<p>Your typical Tampa, FL home insurance policy will include two separate deductibles: your usual home insurance deductible and a separate <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a>. You don’t have to purchase <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a> separately – it’s in your standard homeowners policy if it has this deductible. This coverage kicks in when your home experiences wind damage during a hurricane.</p>\n<p>The year your home was built and the wind mitigation improvements you make to your home can have a real impact on what you pay for your homeowners insurance. Florida requires home insurance providers to offer discounts to homeowners with wind-protected homes.</p>\n<p>If your home was built prior to 2001 (i.e., before stronger post-Hurricane Andrew building codes took effect), you may want to do some upgrades to protect your home from hurricane winds and to save money on your insurance.</p>\n<p>Homes built after the statewide 2002 building codes were in force are built with stronger materials for roof reinforcement and impact-resistant windows. These homes often qualify for <a href=\"/glossary/wind-mitigation/\">wind mitigation credits</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mediancostofhomeownersinsuranceintampa\">Median Cost of Homeowners Insurance in Tampa</h2>\n<p>The <strong>median cost of homeowners insurance in Tampa is $2,107</strong>, according to our data.
