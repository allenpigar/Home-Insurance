Kin’s <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policy</a> protects your home against a variety of losses, including wildfires. It can cover damage for all perils except those explicitly excluded in the policy, such as damage from earth movement (think: earthquakes, sinkholes, and mudslides). That said, in most cases, you can add on coverage for excluded losses. For example, if you need earthquake insurance, just ask us for details.</p>\n<p>Additionally, our California homeowners insurance offers green home increased cost coverage (so you can rebuild with green-certified materials).</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The absolute best insurance company I have ever worked with in my life without exception.

Your <a href=\"/blog/refinancing-your-mortgage/\">mortgage</a> lender requires you to have homeowners insurance for two reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To protect their investment.</strong> Your policy ensures you can pay your remaining mortgage even if your home is completely destroyed in a natural disaster like a wildfire.</li>\n<li><strong>To keep you from paying for a destroyed home you can’t repair.</strong> The requirement is good for you, too – imagine repaying a mortgage for a home you can’t afford to rebuild.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Defaulting on a mortgage for a home is one thing – it can always be repossessed and resold. But if the home is completely destroyed and you don’t have insurance, your mortgage company would have to pay to rebuild it.
