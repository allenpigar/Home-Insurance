It's also one of the <a href=\"/blog/4-safest-cities-in-america/\">safest cities in America</a>.</p>\n<p>While the sunshine suits the Happiest Place on Earth, Anaheim’s position between two major fault lines makes earthquakes a real risk.

Even though the state is experiencing a major drought, thunderstorms can drop enough water to create flood conditions in parts of the city.

Anaheim is situated between two major, active fault zones: the Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone to the southwest and the Whittier-Elsinore Fault Zone to the northeast.</p>\n<p>While earthquake insurance doesn’t come standard with your homeowners insurance, you can add on this essential coverage. It protects your home, other structures, and personal belongings if they’re damaged by earth movement.

It’s the right mix of affordability, proximity to the great outdoors, and good school districts. Plus, it’s full of hidden gems – did you know there’s a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house here? It’s a private residence, so no public tours. It’s the only California Wright structure that can’t be spotted from the street.</p>\n<p>But the risks in Bakersfield are well known. Between wildfires and earthquakes, homeowners have to prepare for the worst, and that can make buying <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">home insurance in California</a> difficult. Luckily, it doesn’t have to be. With Kin, Bakersfield homeowners can get insured in minutes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bakersfieldhomeinsurancecosts\">Bakersfield Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>The average <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">cost of homeowners insurance</a> in California is $1,211 a year, but Bakersfield homeowners enjoy much lower rates – $621 a year on average with Kin. You can see how competitive our prices are below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averagebakersfieldhomeinsurancepremiumsbycompany\">Average Bakersfield Home Insurance Premiums by Company</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Allstate</th>\n<th>Travelers</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$621</td>\n<td>$519</td>\n<td>$546</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Remember, your rates may vary depending on your home’s age, size, construction, and safety features. Your claims history can impact your premium, too. The best way to know what you’ll pay for coverage is to get a quote.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatbakersfieldhomeinsurancecovers\">What Bakersfield Home Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p>While some insurance companies may cut coverage to cut costs, we never do. Every Kin HO3 policy includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: Pays to repair or replace your home if it’s damaged in a covered claim.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: Protects garages, gazebos, sheds, and other structures on your property.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: Pays to repair or replace your personal belongings if they are damaged, destroyed, or stolen.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: Provides an allowance for extra living expenses while your home is being repaired.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: Pays settlement costs and legal fees when you’re sued over someone’s bodily harm or property damage.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: Covers immediate medical expenses when guests are injured on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also customize your coverage with <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a> – think of these as mini policies that add on extra coverage to fit your lifestyle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bigrisksforbakersfieldhomeowners\">Big Risks for Bakersfield Homeowners</h2>\n<p>While your homeowners insurance policy can cover fires, vandalism, windstorms, internal water damage, and theft, standard policies don’t cover floods and earthquakes. Bakersfield homeowners who want that protection will need to add on that coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bakersfieldwildfirecoverage\">Bakersfield Wildfire Coverage</h3>\n<p>Bakersfield is surrounded by open space. Thanks to California’s historic drought and an abundance of dry brush, this open space can catch fire with the smallest of sparks. Yet nearly 1.2 million homes are being built in some of the <a href=\"https://edmdigest.com/response/more-than-1-million-homes-planned-for-high-risk-fire-areas-in-california-should-they-be-built/\">highest wildfire risk zones</a> that exist in California. Many of these homes will be unable to get traditional homeowners insurance because of their wildfire risk.</p>\n<p>That said, all Kin policies include <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire insurance</a>, so that’s one less thing to worry about as you plan for your home’s fire safety.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bakersfieldfloodinsurance\">Bakersfield Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>Bakersfield is a good drive from the closest beach, but its lakes and drainage systems make it prone to floods. If <a href=\"https://kernpublicworks.com/building-and-development/floodplain-management/lake-isabella-flood-area/\">Lake Isabella</a>’s dam fails, there could be significant flooding in the area. Unfortunately, a standard home insurance policy doesn’t cover damage from floods and rising water.</p>\n<p>But we can easily add on <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> to make sure your home is protected for whatever comes your way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"earthquakecoverageinbakersfield\">Earthquake Coverage in Bakersfield</h3>\n<p>In 2016, <a href=\"https://bakersfieldnow.com/news/local/increased-risk-of-major-earthquake-after-series-of-small-temblors\">96 earthquakes</a> with a magnitude of 2.0 or higher were recorded within four days in the Salton Sea in Bakersfield. The area’s high seismic activity keeps residents wondering when the next big one will happen. They’ll need earthquake insurance to protect them when it does.</p>\n<p>To add on earthquake insurance, just ask us. This covers your home, other structures, and belongings if there’s an earthquake. You also get loss of use, debris removal, demolition, and building code upgrade coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforlowerbakersfieldhomeinsurancecosts\">Tips for Lower Bakersfield Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>While Bakersfield enjoys super affordable premiums, we think you should get as many discounts as possible. We offer <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">homeowners insurance discounts</a> for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart home safety and security devices.</li>\n<li>Secure communities.</li>\n<li>Electronic policies.</li>\n<li>Ember resistant venting.</li>\n<li>Annual brush removal contract.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/leed-certified-home/\">LEED-certified homes</a>.</li>\n<li>New homebuyers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reducing claims is a big help in reducing premiums. You might even increase your deductible to deter yourself from making smaller claims. Another perk: higher deductible fetch lower premiums.</p>"

Today, the city is home to 214,547 residents. You can visit the renovated Art Deco Center Stage theater, the Steelworkers’ Auditorium, the Auto Club Speedway, or explore the San Gabriel Mountains.</p>\n<p>Fontana has a lower cost of living than neighboring California hot spots, but at 125.6, its cost of living index is above the national average of 100. That makes it all the more important to find affordable <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California home insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fontanahomeinsurancecosts\">Fontana Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Fontana home insurance costs $1,094 on average with Kin. That’s very competitive considering the <a href=\"https://www.bestplaces.net/cost_of_living/city/california/fontana\">median home price in Fontana is $400,100</a>, meaning replacement costs skew higher in this area.</p>\n<p>As you shop for insurance, remember not to sacrifice coverage for the sake of saving a little money. The few dollars you’ll save now won’t be worth being underinsured when it’s time to file a claim. We use thousands of data points to offer just the right amount of coverage – no more, no less.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averagefontanahomeinsurancepremiumsbycompany\">Average Fontana Home Insurance Premiums by Company</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Allstate</th>\n<th>Travelers</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$1,094</td>\n<td>$827</td>\n<td>$850</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Averages give you a ballpark impression of what your insurance may cost, but the only way to know for sure what you’ll pay is to get a quote. Your quote reflects your home’s unique characteristics: its age, size, exact location, construction, and safety features. That can make your premium higher or much lower than the average.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatfontanahomeinsurancecovers\">What Fontana Home Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p>Our HO3 policies cover you and your home. You can see a summary of your coverage on your policy’s first page (the <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declarations page</a>). All our policies offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: This pays to repair or rebuild your home’s structure (think: walls, ceilings, floors, roof, etc.).</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: This repairs or rebuilds detached structures on your property, like sheds, fences, guests houses, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: This pays to repair or replace belongings, like appliances, clothing, electronics, furniture, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: If you can’t live at your home because of a covered claim, this can pay for additional living expenses, like temporary lodging, dining out, transportation, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: If you’re sued over someone’s bodily injuries or property damage, this can help pay for your legal fees and settlement costs.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: When a guest is injured on your property, this can help cover their immediate medical bills.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also customize your policy with <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a>. Think of these as mini-policies that make your coverage fit just right. For example, you might want to add on water backup coverage if you’re worried about water damage from overflowing sump pumps or public service lines.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fontanasmajorrisks\">Fontana's Major Risks</h2>\n<p>Natural disasters are a major concern for Fontana homeowners. You have to be prepared for wildfires, floods, and earthquakes. While your homeowners insurance covers a lot of events, it doesn’t cover some major natural disasters. Let’s learn how your policy responds to some of Fontana’s biggest risks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fontanawildfirecoverage\">Fontana Wildfire Coverage</h3>\n<p>Fontana is no stranger to wildfires. The hot dry open space near Fontana puts structures and residents at risk. Recently, in July 2020, the <a href=\"https://wildfiretoday.com/2020/07/27/karen-fire-burns-277-acres-near-fontana-california/\">Karen Fire</a> burned 277 acres near Fontana. For residents who live close to open space, getting homeowners insurance can be difficult or expensive.</p>\n<p>Luckily, all our policies include <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire insurance</a> to help repair your home, belongings, and other structures when they’re damaged by fire, smoke, or internal explosion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fontanafloodinsurance\">Fontana Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.fontana.org/3262/Flood\">city of Fontana’s website</a>, floods are common here. Even though Southern California is in the midst of a major drought, it can still flood in the lowlands where drainage is poor and the ground isn’t prepared to absorb a lot of water in a short period of time.</p>\n<p>Only <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> covers water damage from floods, rising waters, and storm surges, but you can easily add it to your policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"earthquakecoverageinfontana\">Earthquake Coverage in Fontana</h3>\n<p>In 2020, Fontana had more than <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-earthquake-strikes-near-fontana-california-20190616-story.html\">700 tremors</a>. Most of these were small and did no damage. But they serve as a reminder that the area is prone to shakers and it’s just a matter of time before a big one strikes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtolowerfontanahomeinsurancecosts\">How to Lower Fontana Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>The safer your home is, the lower your insurance costs will be. We offer easy home insurance <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart home safety and security devices.</li>\n<li>Secure communities.</li>\n<li>Electronic policies.</li>\n<li>Ember resistant venting.</li>\n<li>Annual brush removal contract.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/leed-certified-home/\">LEED-certified homes</a>.</li>\n<li>New homebuyers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you don’t mind covering a little more out of pocket during a claim, you can save even more by increasing your deductible. Just make sure you only take on a deductible you could cover on short notice because losses happen with little notice.</p>"

Film aficionados appreciate the Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum full of filmmaking artifacts while architecture nerds enjoy the Mission San José, a 1700s Spanish Mission and museum. And folks who love the great outdoors swear by the magic of Coyote Hills Regional Park for hiking, biking, and exploring. There’s plenty of wonder here.</p>\n<p>And part of enjoying Fremont means having the peace of mind that your home is protected with <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">affordable California home insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fremonthomeinsurancecosts\">Fremont Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Fremont <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">home insurance costs</a> $1,149 a year on average with Kin. That’s 69 percent cheaper than Allstate ($1,943 a year) and 6 percent cheaper than Travelers ($1,214 a year). How do we keep our costs so low?

Good thing that’s super easy – most homeowners can get a quote from Kin in under a minute and buy their policy in less than five.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatfremonthomeinsurancecovers\">What Fremont Home Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p>Every Kin homeowners insurance policy offers five core protections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: This helps you repair or rebuild your home from the ground up and restore its previous splendor after a covered event (like fire, windstorms, etc.).</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: This covers detached structures on your property, like your garage, gazebo, shed, fence, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: This covers all the items that make your house a home – your furniture, electronics, clothing, bookshelves, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: If your home is under repair because of a claim, this can help pay for additional expenses while you’re living away from home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: If you’re sued over someone’s bodily injuries or property damage, this can help pay for your legal expenses.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: When your guests have a small injury on your property, this can cover their immediate medical expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also customize your policy with <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a>. Think of these as mini policies – they add a little extra coverage based on your needs and interests. For example, if your family includes beloved dogs, you might want to add on <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">animal liability insurance</a>. This can help pay for damages your fluffy friends may cause.

It has the lowest rate of violent crime of cities with more than 100,000 residents, according to <a href=\"https://livability.com/ca/irvine/experiences-adventures/8-reasons-to-move-to-irvine-ca\">FBI statistics</a>. Throughout the city, you can see proof that residents take pride in making their neighborhoods welcoming. Given its thriving economy, it’s no surprise that Irvine is home to more than a hundred corporate headquarters.</p>\n<p>Median home prices in the area are $864,400, about $300,000 more than California’s overall median. The higher cost of living makes it all the more important to save where you can by finding affordable <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California home insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"irvinehomeinsurancecosts\">Irvine Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>The average <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">cost of home insurance</a> in Irvine is $1,640 a year with Kin. Compare that to $1,873 from Allstate and $1,707 from Travelers. An Irvine homeowner may save $233 or 14 percent on their homeowners insurance if they switched to Kin from Allstate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageirvinehomeinsurancepremiumsbycompany\">Average Irvine Home Insurance Premiums by Company</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Allstate</th>\n<th>Travelers</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$1,640</td>\n<td>$1,873</td>\n<td>$1,707</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Averages give you a good idea of what the costs in your area look like, but the only way to know for sure what you’ll pay for coverage is to get a quote. Your quote will reflect your home: its size, age, construction, and safety features. These can make your cost higher or lower than the average.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatirvinehomeinsurancecovers\">What Irvine Home Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p>If you’re new to homeowners insurance, you can get a high-level overview of what your policy covers by turning to the <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declarations page</a>, usually the first page in your packet. With Kin, all our policies offer this protection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: Pays repair or rebuild your home – the actual structure – if it’s damaged in a covered loss.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: Covers the costs to repair or replace other structures on your property, like fences, gazebos, and sheds.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: Replaces or repairs your belongings if they’re damaged by a covered loss, like fire or theft.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: Provides an allowance for additional living expenses if you have to stay somewhere else because your home was damaged in a covered event.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: Pays legal and settlement costs when you’re sued over someone’s property damage or bodily injury.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: Pays for immediate medical expenses when guests are injured while visiting you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also customize your policy with <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a>. For example, if you have a golf cart, you can add on golf cart coverage. If you’re worried about mold damage, there’s an endorsement for that, too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"irvinesmajorrisks\">Irvine's Major Risks</h2>\n<p>Our <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> policies cover damage to your home from all events except for those explicitly excluded. That covers a lot of ground – damage from fire, windstorms, internal water damage (e.g., leaking appliances), theft, vandalism, and more. But there are a couple big events that don’t come with a standard policy that Irvine homeowners may want to consider.</p>\n<h3 id=\"irvinewildfireinsurance\">Irvine Wildfire Insurance</h3>\n<p>Many Irvine homeowners may live inside what’s called the <a href=\"https://www.cityofirvine.org/ipd-divisions-bureaus-units/wildfires\">Wildland / Urban Interface</a> (WUI). This is a region next to open space areas and is at risk for wildfires. In the past, getting homeowners insurance was tricky for folks in this region because the risk of wildfires is so great. All our policies include <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire insurance</a> to make sure you’re protected for the risks your property may face.</p>\n<h3 id=\"irvinefloodinsurance\">Irvine Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>The fact that Southern California is in a drought doesn’t mean that the area isn’t prone to flooding. Thanks to the dry, clay-like soil, rain can rarely saturate the ground. Instead, it runs off hills and slopes, pooling in low lying areas. Homeowners insurance may cover water damage from a burst pipe in the house, but it won’t cover floods. You can add on <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> for this protection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"irvineearthquakeinsurance\">Irvine Earthquake Insurance</h3>\n<p>The San Andreas and San Jacinto faults run through Irvine, making earthquake damage a big risk for homeowners here. Unfortunately, earthquakes aren’t covered by a standard homeowners insurance policy, but you can add on earthquake insurance for that protection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetlowerirvinehomeinsurancecosts\">How to Get Lower Irvine Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Want to save even more on your insurance? We’ll check to see if you can get these easy <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">home insurance discounts</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart home safety and security devices.</li>\n<li>Secure communities.</li>\n<li>Electronic policies.</li>\n<li>Ember resistant venting.</li>\n<li>Annual brush removal contract.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/leed-certified-home/\">LEED-certified homes</a>.</li>\n<li>New homebuyers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also adjust your deductible to help you save more. Usually, the higher your deductible, the lower your premium. Just make sure you only take on a deductible you can spare on short notice. It will be deducted from your claims payout.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"affordablehomeownersinsuranceinlongbeachcalifornia\">Affordable Homeowners Insurance in Long Beach, California</h2>\n<p>Long Beach, California, is the perfect place for waterfront lovers to lay down roots. From Alamitos Beach and Junipero Cherry Beach to Belmont Shore, there’s plenty of coast for everyone to enjoy. Even your dog is welcome at Rosie’s Dog Beach! History buffs can wander the RMS Queen Mary, a retired ocean liner and museum, moored in the Queensway Bay. Animal enthusiasts can explore the Aquarium of the Pacific complete with its touch tanks and shark lagoon. And there’s lots of art and culture in Long Beach, too, like the Rancho Los Cerritos museum and gardens.</p>\n<p>But living on the coast comes with its risks, like floods or earthquakes. Long Beach homeowners need the right <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California home insurance</a> to cover whatever comes their way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"longbeachhomeinsurancecosts\">Long Beach Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>On average, Long Beach <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">home insurance costs</a> $1,388 a year with Kin. Other insurers aren’t much different: Allstate averages $1,333 a year and Travelers averages $1,395 a year. You can see how we compare below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averagelongbeachhomeinsurancepremiumsbycompany\">Average Long Beach Home Insurance Premiums by Company</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Allstate</th>\n<th>Travelers</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$1,388</td>\n<td>$1,333</td>\n<td>$1,395</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Remember, averages are useful for giving you a ballpark impression of what your insurance may cost. But your exact premium may be much lower depending on your home’s characteristics. <a href=\"/\">Apply for a free quote</a> to see if you can save money on your home insurance. Most homeowners who <a href=\"/blog/customer-savings-survey/\">switch to Kin save hundreds</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatlongbeachhomeinsurancecovers\">What Long Beach Home Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p>Your policy protects your home and everything in it (well, almost!). It also covers accidents and mishaps. All our policies include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: Pays to repair or rebuild your home after it’s damaged or destroyed.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: Repairs or replaces detached structures on the property, like gazebos, guest homes, and fences.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: Repairs or replaces your personal belongings, like clothing, furniture, appliances, electronics, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: Pays for additional living expenses – like hotel stays, laundry, and takeout – when a covered claim keeps you from living in your home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: Covers legal fees and settlements when you’re sued over someone’s property damage or bodily injury.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: Pays for small medical bills when a guest is injured at your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also add on coverage with <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a>. Think of these as mini-policies that customize your coverage so it fits your needs and lifestyle. For example, if you have dogs, adding animal liability insurance may make sense. This can help pay for Fido-related mishaps, like if your pup jumps on a visitor and knocks them over. This coverage can help cover those medical bills.</p>\n<h2 id=\"longbeachsmajorrisks\">Long Beach's Major Risks</h2>\n<p>Our standard <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> policy covers your home for damage from all events except those explicitly excluded. That means you have coverage for fire, theft, vandalism, windstorms, internal water damage (a burst pipe), and much more.</p>\n<p>But some events, like floods and earthquakes, aren’t covered outright. Let’s take a look at how your policy responds to some common natural disasters.</p>\n<h3 id=\"longbeachwildfirecoverage\">Long Beach Wildfire Coverage</h3>\n<p>Virtually no community in California is exempt from wildfires. Though Long Beach isn’t next to a lot of open space and is flanked by the ocean and other communities, it does experience smoke damage from neighboring wildfires. Every Kin insurance policy includes <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire insurance</a>, which covers smoke damage. You don’t need to request this coverage – it’s already there.</p>\n<h3 id=\"longbeachfloodinsurance\">Long Beach Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>Most of Long Beach is <a href=\"http://www.longbeach.gov/pw/resources/engineering/flood-zone/\">at risk for floods</a>, thanks to its proximity to the ocean and flatlands with poor drainage. Long Beach residents could experience a flood during heavy rains or when a tropical storm makes landfall. To protect your home from floods, rising water, and storm surges, ask us to add on <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"earthquakecoverageinlongbeach\">Earthquake Coverage in Long Beach</h3>\n<p>While Long Beach hasn’t had a major quake recently, residents may remember the <a href=\"https://www.conservation.ca.gov/cgs/earthquakes/long-beach\">1933 Long Beach Earthquake</a>, a 6.4 magnitude quake that caused $50 million dollars in damage (in 1933 dollars). Because of this quake, the Field Act was passed to set better building standards.</p>\n<p>Homeowners insurance doesn’t cover earthquake damage. For that protection, you can add on earthquake insurance. It helps you rebuild your home and replace your belongings when a quake strikes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtolowerlongbeachhomeinsurancecosts\">How to Lower Long Beach Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Looking for more ways to save on your coverage? Safety features like smart home security devices and defensible space offer easy discounts. You can also get <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart home safety and security devices.</li>\n<li>Secure communities.</li>\n<li>Electronic policies.</li>\n<li>Ember resistant venting.</li>\n<li>Annual brush removal contract.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/leed-certified-home/\">LEED-certified homes</a>.</li>\n<li>New homebuyers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Filing fewer claims can also keep your rates low over time. Generally, catastrophic claims, like wildfire damage, hurt your rates less than smaller claims, like a stolen laptop.</p>\n<p>You can also increase your deductible to lower your premium. Just make sure you’re comfortable with your out-of-pocket costs if you do need to file a claim.</p>"

Home to Hollywood, celebrities, and some of the country’s most beloved artists, it’s a city designed to enchant. It’s no wonder four million residents call this place home.</p>\n<p>But even paradise has its risks. Between theft, wildfires, and earthquakes, Los Angeles homeowners need insurance that can keep up. That’s where we come in. Learn about <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California homeowners insurance</a> – from what it covers to what it costs in Los Angeles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"losangeleshomeinsurancecosts\">Los Angeles Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Los Angeles home insurance costs $1,388 on average from Kin. You can see how we compare to Travelers’ price below – about 1 percent cheaper. That might not seem like much, but combined with how fast and easy it is to get insurance with us, it adds up. Time is money, after all.</p>\n<p>Most LA homes have soaring market values, but that doesn’t necessarily mean your home’s <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-and-home-price/\">replacement cost will match its price tag</a>. And that’s a good thing! You pay far less insuring your home for what it costs to rebuild it from the ground up than you would if you had to factor in the value of its location and other intangibles that drive up home prices.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averagelosangeleshomeinsurancepremiumsbycompany\">Average Los Angeles Home Insurance Premiums by Company</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Allstate</th>\n<th>Travelers</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$1,388</td>\n<td>$1,333</td>\n<td>$1,395</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Remember, the cost of your coverage varies based on your home’s location.

It’s a good thing, too – nearly 26 out of every 1,000 Los Angeles residents experience a <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ca/los-angeles/crime\">property crime</a>. But it isn’t just the crime that you need to look out for.</p>\n<h3 id=\"losangeleswildfirecoverage\">Los Angeles Wildfire Coverage</h3>\n<p>In 2019, the <a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2019/\">Getty Fire</a> threatened Los Angeles’ million-dollar homes along the 405 Freeway and the famous Getty Center and its millions of dollars in artwork. It seems that nowhere in Los Angeles is safe from the wildfires. For those who live in the hills, this threat can make getting homeowners insurance incredibly difficult. Many insurance companies won’t cover homes in wildfire zones to curb their losses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">Wildfire insurance</a> simply means that your insurance will cover damage caused by wildfires. It’s included in most standard homeowners insurance policies, including ours.</p>\n<h3 id=\"losangelesfloodinsurance\">Los Angeles Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>While most of the flood zones in Los Angeles are near the beach, parts of the city are also prone to flooding. It’s hard to imagine flooding when you are in one of the worst droughts in California history. But if an El Niño year comes along with heavy rains, there could be massive flooding throughout Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Luckily, you can add <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> to your policy. It doesn’t come standard with your coverage, but for a little extra, you can protect your home from all the elements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"earthquakecoverageinlosangeles\">Earthquake Coverage in Los Angeles</h3>\n<p>Earthquake insurance isn’t required in California – not even lenders require it on new home mortgages. But the <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-probability-earthquake-will-occur-los-angeles-area-san-francisco-bay-area?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products\">USGS</a> says there’s a 60 percent chance of a 6.7 magnitude earthquake in the Los Angeles area. Homeowners insurance doesn’t cover earthquake damage.</p>\n<p>Earthquake insurance covers the damage that happens while the earth is shaking, whether that is 10 seconds or what seems like 10 minutes. Ask us to add it to your policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforloweringlosangeleshomeinsurancecosts\">Tips for Lowering Los Angeles Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>The cost of living in Los Angeles is high enough.

Between Box Springs Mountain and Lake Perris, there’s plenty of hiking, camping, and fishing to do. And you can always learn something new at the March Field Air Museum or the Orange Empire Railway Museum. Add in the affordable cost of living, and it’s no wonder Moreno Valley is such a popular place to live – it more than doubled in size since 1990.</p>\n<p>But Moreno Valley homeowners need the right <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California home insurance</a> to protect their home from wildfires and more.

Keep in mind that includes <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire insurance</a>, a must-have for homeowners near open space.</p>\n<p>When comparing insurance options, remember to make sure your home’s replacement cost is accurate. This cost may be <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-and-home-price/\">more or less than the market value of your home</a> because it doesn’t account for amenities, the land your home sits on, or curb appeal.

When shopping for insurance, make sure you’re comparing apples to apples. There’s a big difference between a policy that only offers <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value coverage</a> for your home and one that offers <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost coverage</a>.</p>\n<p>Your home insurance should offer these basic protections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: Pays to repair or rebuild your home if it’s damaged or destroyed.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: Pays to repair or rebuild detached structures on your property, like sheds, fences, or guest units.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: Pays to replace or repair your belongings, like furniture, appliances, electronics, clothing, decor, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: Pays for temporary lodging and additional living expenses when a covered claim keeps you from living at home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: Pays for legal expenses when you’re sued over someone’s property damage or bodily injuries.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: Covers small medical bills for guests who get injured on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also customize your policy with <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a>. For example, you could add on <a href=\"/blog/is-mold-covered-by-home-insurance/\">coverage for mold damage</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"morenovalleysmajorrisks\">Moreno Valley's Major Risks</h2>\n<p>Your Kin policy covers all events except those the policy lists as exclusions, and that covers a lot: theft, fire, windstorms, appliance water damage, and more. But what about natural disasters? Standard insurance policies don’t cover earthquakes or floods, but that doesn’t mean you’re out of luck.</p>\n<h3 id=\"morenovalleywildfirecoverage\">Moreno Valley Wildfire Coverage</h3>\n<p>Moreno Valley’s great outdoors is a double-edged sword: its proximity to open space is a delight for those who love nature, but open space is a serious wildfire risk. The area experiences frequent small wildfires that burn hundreds of acres of land throughout the year. If you’re a homeowner who lives near open space, it may be tricky to get insurance. Luckily, all our policies include <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire insurance</a>, which covers fire, smoke, and internal explosion damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"morenovalleyfloodinsurance\">Moreno Valley Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>In a valley, the area is surrounded by higher ground where runoff can easily create flash flooding. Most homeowners in the area should consider flood insurance to cover damage caused by rising waters and storm surges. You can add on <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> for that protection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"earthquakecoverageinmorenovalley\">Earthquake Coverage in Moreno Valley</h3>\n<p>Moreno Valley gets its fair share of California shakers, mostly a magnitude 3.5 or less. These small shakers are a good reminder that the big one is inevitable. Unfortunately, homeowners insurance doesn’t cover earthquake damage, but earthquake insurance does. This can cover damage to your home and belongings caused by the shaking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtolowermorenovalleyhomeinsurancecosts\">How to Lower Moreno Valley Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Moreno Valley homeowners can save even more on home insurance by making homes safer. We offer easy <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> for safety devices, brush removal, and more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart home safety and security devices.</li>\n<li>Secure communities.</li>\n<li>Electronic policies.</li>\n<li>Ember resistant venting.</li>\n<li>Annual brush removal contract.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/leed-certified-home/\">LEED-certified homes</a>.</li>\n<li>New homebuyers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also choose a higher deductible for lower yearly premiums. Slightly higher out-of-pocket costs when you file a claim may be worth the lower insurance bill. Plus, a higher deductible discourages smaller claims, which helps you stay claims-free longer.</p>"

Just across the bridge from San Francisco, the sun always seems to be shining on this side of the Bay. Oakland is home to Jack London Square, named for the writer who regularly adventured here. And there’s plenty to do and see between the city’s many boutiques, galleries, Victorian architecture, and the famous art deco Fox Theater. Plus, the Oakwood Redwood Regional Park is only 20 minutes away.</p>\n<p>But even the greatest cities have their risks. Homeowners searching for <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California homeowners insurance</a> should make sure their policy can stand up to elements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"oaklandhomeinsurancecosts\">Oakland Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Our Oakland <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">home insurance costs</a> are incredibly competitive. At an average of $1,149 a year, we’re 69 percent cheaper than Allstate and 6 percent cheaper than Travelers. You can see how we stack up in the chart below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averageoaklandhomeinsurancepremiumsbycompany\">Average Oakland Home Insurance Premiums by Company</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Allstate</th>\n<th>Travelers</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$1,149</td>\n<td>$1,943</td>\n<td>$1,214</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Keep in mind that home insurance costs vary depending on your home and your insurance history. Safety features also play a big role in the discounts you qualify for. To see exactly what your coverage will cost, get a quote! It’s free and doesn’t impact your credit score.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatoaklandhomeinsurancecovers\">What Oakland Home Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p>Not all policies are created equal. Make sure yours strikes the right balance between essential coverage and affordability. For example, all our <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policies</a> offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: This pays to repair or rebuild your home after a covered loss.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: This can repair or rebuild other structures on your property, like garages, sheds, gazebos, and fences.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: This pays to replace or repair your belongings, like electronics, furnishings, clothing, furniture, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: This gives you an allowance to cover additional living expenses when a covered loss keeps you from staying at home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: If you’re sued over someone’s bodily injuries or property damage, this can cover your legal expenses (think: attorney fees and settlements).</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: If a guest is injured at your home, this can pay for their immediate medical expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also customize your policy with <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a>. Think of these as mini policies that add on coverage to fit your lifestyle. For example, if you have a merry band of Pomeranians, adding on <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">animal liability insurance</a> may make sense. This can pay for damage or injuries your fluffy friends cause.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bigrisksforoaklandhomeowners\">Big Risks for Oakland Homeowners</h2>\n<p>A standard <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> policy can cover loss from fire, vandalism, windstorms, water damage, and theft (Oakland has a <a href=\"https://www.movoto.com/blog/homeownership/is-oakland-a-good-place-to-live/\">crime index 138 percent</a> higher than the California average). But there are other risks a standard policy may not cover. Here’s what you need to know.</p>\n<h3 id=\"oaklandwildfirecoverage\">Oakland Wildfire Coverage</h3>\n<p>In 1991, the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/fire-sweeps-through-oakland-hills\">Oakland Hills firestorm</a> (aka the East Bay Hills Fire) burned thousands of homes and claimed 25 lives. And Oakland faces similar fire risk to this day as the state continues to face the worst drought in its history.</p>\n<p>All Kin policies include <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire insurance</a> to make sure your home is prepared for the worst-case scenario. This covers fire, smoke, and explosion damage to your home, belongings, and other structures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"oaklandfloodinsurance\">Oakland Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>Oakland sits on the bay, meaning homeowners face their share of <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/oak035219.pdf\">flood hazards</a>, like stormwater runoff, tsunamis, seiches, damn failure, and a rise in sea level. In 2019, the <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/weather/article/west-oakland-flooding-880-nimitz-freeway-7th-13616759.php\">Nimitz Freeway underpass</a> made national news for its intense flooding.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, homeowners insurance doesn’t cover damage from rising waters. It only covers water damage that comes from inside the house, like a leaking appliance or burst pipe. To get flood protection, ask us to add on <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> to your policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"earthquakecoverageinoakland\">Earthquake Coverage in Oakland</h3>\n<p>There’s a <a href=\"https://sf.curbed.com/2019/7/8/20686322/earthquake-odds-bay-area-san-francisco-california-prepare\">72 percent chance</a> that Oakland will have an earthquake of 6.7 or higher in the next 23 years. The area is no stranger to big shakers – in October 1989, the Loma Prieta earthquake was a 6.9 magnitude tremor.</p>\n<p>Homeowners insurance doesn’t cover earthquakes, but we can add on earthquake insurance to help deal with the aftermath of a major quake. It’s the only coverage that pays for damage to your home, other structures, and belongings caused by earth movement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforloweroaklandhomeinsurancecosts\">Tips for Lower Oakland Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>While our prices are already low, we take every opportunity to help you save more.

Learn about <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California home insurance</a> rates, what policies cover, and more ways to save on home insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"riversidehomeinsurancecosts\">Riverside Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Riverside <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">homeowners insurance costs</a> $1,095 a year on average with Kin, but your rates may vary based on your neighborhood, your home’s age and safety features, and more.

As much as 64 percent of homes are underinsured by 27 percent, and that difference can leave you high and dry when it’s time to file a claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatriversidehomeinsurancecovers\">What Riverside Home Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p>Our policies offer core coverages that protect your home and everything in it. Every policy has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: Pays to repair or rebuild your home if it’s damaged by a covered event.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: Pays to repair or replace the other structures on your property, like sheds, gazebos, detached garages, and fences.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: Protects all the things in your house that make it a home: electronics, furniture, furnishings, clothing, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: Provides an allowance for additional living expenses when a covered claim keeps you from living at home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: Pays for legal expenses when you’re sued over someone’s bodily injuries or property damage.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: Covers immediate medical expenses when a guest is injured at your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also customize your policy with <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a>. Think of these as mini insurance policies that make your coverage fit like a glove. These can raise your limits or add on specialty coverage (like flood</p>\n<p>insurance or mold coverage).</p>\n<h2 id=\"riversidesbiggestrisks\">Riverside's Biggest Risks</h2>\n<p>Every standard <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> policy covers damage from fire, windstorms, internal water damage, vandalism, and theft. But sometimes you need a little extra coverage to make sure your home is ready for big disasters.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at the disasters every Riverside homeowner should prepare for.</p>\n<h3 id=\"riversidewildfirecoverage\">Riverside Wildfire Coverage</h3>\n<p>In August 2020, over <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/08/riverside-apple-fire-scorches-20000-acres-8000-evacuees-1203001858/\">20,000 acres burned</a> in an uncontained wildfire. More than 7,800 people were forced to evacuate. It’s a stark reminder that Riverside residents face real wildfire risk and could be forced to evacuate on a moment’s notice.</p>\n<p>If you live in or near wildfire zones, you already know how difficult it can be to get homeowners insurance that covers you for wildfires. Good news: we cover Riverside homeowners and all our policies include <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire insurance</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"riversidefloodinsurance\">Riverside Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>Riverside’s hills and low lying flatlands make for perfect flood conditions during a downpour. Unfortunately, homeowners insurance doesn’t cover flood damage from rising waters around and into the home.</p>\n<p>But you can easily add <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> to your policy for this essential protection. Just ask us about it!</p>\n<h3 id=\"earthquakecoverageinriverside\">Earthquake Coverage in Riverside</h3>\n<p>California, home to the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults, is no stranger to earthquakes. As recent as August 11, 2020, Southern California experienced a swarm of earthquakes with experts predicting an <a href=\"https://patch.com/california/palmdesert/earthquake-swarm-continues-socal-larger-quakes-possible\">18 percent chance of a 4.5 to 5.4</a> magnitude shaker.</p>\n<p>While earthquake insurance isn’t included in your policy automatically, you can easily add it on. This is the only coverage that can pay for damage to your home, other structures, and belongings caused by shaking earth movement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforlowerriversidehomeinsurancecosts\">Tips for Lower Riverside Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Take your home insurance savings even further. We’ll check to see if you qualify for these big <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart home safety and security devices.</li>\n<li>Secure communities.</li>\n<li>Electronic policies.</li>\n<li>Ember resistant venting.</li>\n<li>Annual brush removal contract.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/leed-certified-home/\">LEED-certified homes</a>.</li>\n<li>New homebuyers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also adjust your deductible to keep your rates in check. Remember, your deductible is the amount you’re responsible for covering out of pocket when you file a claim. Typically, a higher deductible means a lower premium. Just make sure you don’t choose a deductible so high that it bars you from filing claims when you need to.</p>"

It’s absolutely free and only takes minutes! And it doesn’t affect your credit score.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatsanbernardinohomeinsurancecovers\">What San Bernardino Home Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p>Your homeowners insurance policy includes six key protections. These cover your basic and most common risks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: Pays to repair or rebuild your home if it’s damaged or destroyed by fire, windstorm, vandalism, theft, and much more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: Pays to repair or replace structures not attached to your home, like sheds, detached garages, and fences.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: Pays to replace or repair your belongings, like furniture, clothing, electronics, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: Covers temporary lodging and additional living expenses when a covered claim keeps you from living at home for a while.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: Pays for your legal defense and settlement costs when you’re sued over someone’s property damage or bodily injuries.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: Covers the costs of small medical bills for guests who get injured while visiting you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also customize your policy with <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a>.

These might not be the right fit for everyone, which is why they may not come standard.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sanbernardinosmajorrisks\">San Bernardino's Major Risks</h2>\n<p>As picturesque as San Bernardino is, it does have a high crime rate – about <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ca/san-bernardino/crime#:~:text=With%20a%20crime%20rate%20of,here%20is%20one%20in%2017.\">59 crimes per one thousand residents</a>. Your policy protects you for theft and vandalism, but you also need to prepare for natural disasters, like wildfires, floods, and earthquakes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sanbernardinowildfirecoverage\">San Bernardino Wildfire Coverage</h3>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/sbnf/fire\">USDA</a>, the San Bernardino National Forest is one of the most wildfire-prone forests in the country. The mountain forest landscape’s risk extends to the lower flats, too, particularly in areas with severe drought and dry conditions. Fortunately, all Kin policies include <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire insurance</a>. It covers fire and smoke damage if your home is ever exposed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sanbernardinofloodinsurance\">San Bernardino Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>The Santa Ana River runs through San Bernardino, bringing flood risk with it. While homeowners insurance can cover water damage from a pipe bursting in your home, it won’t cover damage from rising water and storm surges. Only <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> can do that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"earthquakecoverageinsanbernardino\">Earthquake Coverage in San Bernardino</h3>\n<p>In March 2020, a <a href=\"https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/06/03/5-1-magnitude-earthquake-strikes-in-san-bernardino-county/\">5.5-magnitude earthquake</a> struck San Bernardino, a reminder that big earthquakes can and will happen here. Homeowners insurance policies don’t cover earthquake damage, but earthquake insurance does. Earthquake insurance policy covers your home, other structures, your belongings, and loss of use. Just ask us to add it on!</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtolowersanbernardinohomeinsurancecosts\">How to Lower San Bernardino Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Investing in safety features for your home can help lower your home insurance rates. We’ll automatically check to see if you qualify for these easy <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">home insurance discounts</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart home safety and security devices.</li>\n<li>Secure communities.</li>\n<li>Electronic policies.</li>\n<li>Ember-resistant venting.</li>\n<li>Annual brush removal contract.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/leed-certified-home/\">LEED-certified homes</a>.</li>\n<li>New homebuyers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can save even more if you choose a higher deductible.

At Kin, our <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> is an <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3</a> policy, a perfect balance of robust coverage and affordable prices. It offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: This pays to repair or rebuild your home – the exterior and interior walls, roof, ceiling, cabinetry, floors, etc.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: This helps repair or rebuild other structures on your property, like fences, sheds, detached garages, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: This pays to repair or replace all the belongings in your home, like clothes, furniture, appliances, electronics, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: This helps pay for additional living expenses when a claim forces you to temporarily live away from home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: This helps cover legal expenses if you’re sued over someone’s bodily harm or property damage.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: This can pay for medical bills when your guests have a small injury at your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can add on more coverage (with <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a>) to customize your policy to fit your lifestyle. For example, if you have a dog, adding on some <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">animal liability insurance</a> may make sense for you. This helps pay for injuries or damage your pup causes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"majorrisksforsandiegohomeowners\">Major Risks for San Diego Homeowners</h2>\n<p>San Diego has a dropping crime rate – the burglary rate is the <a href=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2020-05-20/san-diegos-2019-crime-rate-was-fourth-lowest-in-40-years\">fourth lowest</a> in nearly 40 years. But it has plenty of other risks, like wildfires, floods, and earthquakes. Homeowners insurance covers damage from fire, theft, vandalism, and wind, but you may need to add on coverage for big risks like flooding and earthquakes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sandiegowildfirecoverage\">San Diego Wildfire Coverage</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kpbs.org/news/2019/sep/12/san-diego-among-top-cities-homes-high-risk-wildfir/\">Tens of thousands of homes</a> are at risk for wildfires in San Diego. The California drought has dried up open spaces and made them tinder for even the smallest spark. Unfortunately, not all home insurance companies will cover homes with wildfire exposure.</p>\n<p>But we do, and all our policies include <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire insurance</a>. This pays for damage from fire, smoke, or soot to your home, other structures, and your belongings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sandiegofloodinsurance\">San Diego Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>With its proximity to the beach and several lakes, San Diego homes are at risk for floods. Flood insurance isn’t included in a standard homeowners insurance policy. While your policy can cover water damage from a burst pipe or appliance, only <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> can cover damage from storm surges and rising water.</p>\n<h3 id=\"earthquakecoverageinsandiego\">Earthquake Coverage in San Diego</h3>\n<p>The infamous <a href=\"https://geology.com/articles/san-andreas-fault.shtml#:~:text=The%20San%20Andreas%20Fault%20is,on%20the%20North%20American%20Plate.\">San Andreas Fault</a> passes right through San Diego, making it a prime location for an unsettling shaker. While “The Big One” isn’t a certainty, there is certainly risk for residents and their homes. If a 6.9 magnitude earthquake hit the area, there could be $38 billion in economic losses to over 120,000 structures, according to the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-04/san-diego-earthquake-fault-danger\">Los Angeles Times</a>.</p>\n<p>Earthquake damage isn’t covered by a basic home insurance policy, but we do work with an A-rated partner to offer this essential coverage. Ask us about earthquake insurance to learn more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforloweringsandiegohomeinsurancecosts\">Tips for Lowering San Diego Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Though our home insurance is already affordable, we offer even more ways for San Diego homeowners to save. You can get <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart home safety and security devices.</li>\n<li>Secure communities.</li>\n<li>Electronic policies.</li>\n<li>Ember resistant venting.</li>\n<li>Annual brush removal contract.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/leed-certified-home/\">LEED-certified homes</a>.</li>\n<li>New homebuyers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you haven’t had a claim in three years, you’ll also get a claims-free discount. And you can also adjust your deductibles – the higher the deductible, the lower your premium will be. Just remember: only choose a deductible you’re comfortable paying if you have a loss. Too high a deductible may keep you from filing a claim when you need to.</p>"

Even if you’re not a tech enthusiast, you probably enjoy San Jose for its quirkiness, like its Winchester Mystery House or the larger-than-life Monopoly Board. Or if natural splendor is more your speed, San Jose is a stone’s throw away from the Bay Area beaches and Napa vineyards.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to see why so many folks want to live in San Jose. Many homes sell within 22 days with three or more offers, and the average home value is $1.1 million. And when you’ve invested in a home here, you want to make sure your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> can cover whatever <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California</a> may throw at you, including wildfires and earthquakes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sanjosehomeinsurancecosts\">San Jose Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>A lot of variables play into the cost of San Jose homeowners insurance. For example, the size, age, and construction of your home; its exact location; and your claims history all influence the cost of coverage. In San Jose, our average premium is about $1,206 a year. That's 11 percent cheaper than Travelers.

Most policies cover losses caused by fire, vandalism, wind damage, theft, and more. Because San Jose experiences some property crime (the city has a <a href=\"https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ca/san-jose/crime\">crime index</a> of 15), it’s important to take your home’s security seriously.</p>\n<p>Plus, San Jose is on a fault line and many of its communities are next to open space. This puts San Jose homeowners at risk for wildfire and earthquake damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sanjosewildfireinsurance\">San Jose Wildfire Insurance</h3>\n<p>San Jose is flanked by vast open space. While the landscape is breathtaking, it puts thousands of homes at risk of a wildfire. In 2019, more than $2 million residents were without power thanks to the Kincade Fire that started in Sonoma County and blazed its way to San Jose.</p>\n<p>In recent years, it’s been a struggle for homeowners in wildfire zones to find homeowners insurance. Many resort to coverage offered by the California FAIR Plan. These <a href=\"https://www.cfpnet.com/index.php/consumers/dwelling-policy/\">policies only cover fire and smoke damage</a> and only offer actual cash value coverage. That means it only pays for the depreciated value of the home when there’s a loss.</p>\n<p>We’re happy to offer you another option.

Here’s a rundown:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: This covers what it would cost to rebuild your home from the ground up after a total loss at the going rate for today’s labor and building materials.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: This covers unattached structures on your property, like your detached garage, shed, and fence.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: This pays to repair or replace your personal belongings – clothing, furniture, electronics, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: If a covered claim keeps you from staying at home, this can cover additional living expenses, like the cost of dining out, hotel stays, transportation, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: If someone is hurt at your home or you accidentally injure someone, this can pay for your legal expenses if they sue.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: When a guest has a small injury at your home, this can cover their immediate medical expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also add on <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a> to customize your policy. For example, if you have a cadre of rescue Pomeranians, you might want to add on <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">animal liability insurance</a>. This can help cover Pom-related mischief, like when your timid pup bites visitors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"santaanasbiggestrisks\">Santa Ana's Biggest Risks</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance covers a lot of events, like damage from fire, windstorms, theft, vandalism, and more. But a standard policy doesn’t automatically cover certain catastrophic events, like earthquakes and flooding.</p>\n<p>Don’t lose hope, though! You can add on this coverage easily. Here’s what you need to know.</p>\n<h3 id=\"santaanawildfirecoverage\">Santa Ana Wildfire Coverage</h3>\n<p>Santa Ana’s winds make fast-moving wildfires from the surrounding open space a real risk. The ongoing drought has created plenty of dry brush to act as fuel for the smallest spark. Good thing every Kin policy automatically includes <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire insurance</a> to cover fire, smoke, and explosion damage to your home, belongings, and other structures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"santaanafloodinsurance\">Santa Ana Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>There may be a drought, but significant portions of the city still sit in flood zones. The city has poor drainage and the ground can’t absorb a heavy downpour fast enough to prevent runoff. Residents without flood coverage would have to pay for these damages on their own.</p>\n<p>But we can easily add <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> to your policy. This is the only coverage that can pay for damage caused by rising waters and surges.</p>\n<h3 id=\"earthquakecoverageinsantaana\">Earthquake Coverage in Santa Ana</h3>\n<p>The Long Beach Earthquake of 1933 was miles from Santa Ana, but it still caused significant damage to Santa Ana buildings. Earthquake risk is real for anyone living in Southern California; it can happen at any time, even miles away, and still damage your home. Homeowners insurance doesn’t cover earthquake damage, but we can add on earthquake insurance to keep you protected. Just ask!</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforlowersantaanahomeinsurancecosts\">Tips for Lower Santa Ana Home Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>To help you save even more, we’ll automatically check to see if you’re eligible for these easy home insurance <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart home safety and security devices.</li>\n<li>Secure communities.</li>\n<li>Electronic policies.</li>\n<li>Ember resistant venting.</li>\n<li>Annual brush removal contract.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/leed-certified-home/\">LEED-certified homes</a>.</li>\n<li>New homebuyers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Money-savvy homeowners can also increase their deductible to lower their premium. Plus, by having a larger deductible, you are less likely to make a small <a href=\"/faq/insurance-claims-history/\">claim that stays on your record</a> for years. Choose a deductible that fits your budget but isn’t a burden when you need to file a claim.</p>"

From the Six Flags Magic Mountain theme park to the prehistoric stone formations in Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park, the city has something for every type of adventurer.</p>\n<p>Located near the Angeles National Forest, Santa Clarita is a favorite for outdoor recreation but a target for dangerous wildfires.

We’re pretty competitive with Allstate, too.</p>\n<p>Of course, price shouldn’t be the only consideration when shopping for home insurance. It doesn’t make sense to pay a little less for a policy that will leave you underinsured. It happens more often than you might think. Millions of homes are <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/03/millions-of-homes-are-underinsured-against-natural-disasters.html\">underinsured for natural disasters</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"averagesantaclaritahomeinsurancepremiumsbycompany\">Average Santa Clarita Home Insurance Premiums by Company</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Kin</th>\n<th>Allstate</th>\n<th>Travelers</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$1,388</td>\n<td>$1,333</td>\n<td>$1,395</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Keep in mind that average premiums are just an illustration of what your costs might look like.

Check for these coverages. Every Kin policy offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><strong>dwelling coverage</strong></a>: Pays to fix or rebuild your home if it’s damaged by a covered event (think: fires, windstorms, theft, and more).</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><strong>Other structures coverage</strong></a>: Rebuilds detached structures on your property, like gazebos, garages, and sheds.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal property coverage</strong></a>: Covers the things that make your house a home, like your appliances, furniture, decor, clothing, electronics, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><strong>Loss of use coverage</strong></a>: Provides funds for temporary lodging, transportation, food, and other expenses when a covered claim keeps you from living in your home.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Personal liability coverage</strong></a>: Covers legal expenses when you’re sued over someone’s property damage or bodily injury.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><strong>Medical payments coverage</strong></a>: Covers small medical bills when guests are injured at your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can even add on <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a> to customize your policy.

This part of the high desert is known for wildfires, so the right insurance is a must. Good thing every Kin policy includes <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire insurance</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"santaclaritafloodinsurance\">Santa Clarita Flood Insurance</h3>\n<p>Santa Clarita is filled with hills and valleys. While the area is still experiencing drought conditions, when it does rain, the dry ground doesn’t absorb water fast enough and can cause flash floods. In 2005, the <a href=\"https://www.santa-clarita.com/city-hall/departments/public-works/engineering-services/floodplain-management\">Sand Canyon Mobile Home Park</a> was destroyed after a major flash flood.</p>\n<p>Though <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> doesn’t come standard with home insurance, you can add it on. This is the only coverage that pays for damage caused by rising waters and storm surges.</p>\n<h3 id=\"earthquakecoverageinsantaclarita\">Earthquake Coverage in Santa Clarita</h3>\n<p>The last big earthquake Santa Clarita experienced was the Northridge Earthquake in 1994, but the area frequently has tiny tremors under a 3.0 magnitude.

And a major flood could strike again because of Stockton’s slow-draining soil and proximity to the San Joaquin River. While homeowners insurance doesn’t include <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>, you can add it on to cover damage caused by rising waters and storm surges.
