It’s designed to protect you from disasters big and small. When something goes wrong, you can click your ruby slippers together – or make a claim on your policy – and get your home back to how it once was.</p>\n<p>Homeowners insurance covers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The actual structure of your home, inside and out (this is Coverage A in your policy).</li>\n<li>Other structures, like your garage, fences, and sheds (Coverage B).</li>\n<li>Your belongings that make your house a home (Coverage C).</li>\n<li>Loss of use when an event forces you to temporarily relocate (Coverage D).</li>\n<li>Your personal liability if you’ve accidentally caused someone bodily injury or property damage (Coverage E).</li>\n<li>Medical expenses when a guest has a small injury at your home (Coverage F).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You’re usually <a href=\"/faq/do-i-need-homeowners-insurance/\">required to have home insurance</a> if you have a mortgage. Even if you don't, homeowners insurance is essential protection for one of your life’s biggest investments.</p>\n<p>Let’s learn more about how home insurance works. If you have a condo or mobile home, skip over here to learn about our <a href=\"/condo-insurance/\">condo insurance</a> and <a href=\"/home-insurance/mobile-home-insurance/\">mobile home insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yourhomeinsurancepolicyataglance\">Your Home Insurance Policy at a Glance</h2>\n<p>These are the types of protection a typical home insurance policy offers. Click the icons below to learn what each part of your policy covers (and excludes) in more detail.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/cream-house.jpg\" alt=\"cream-house\" /></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"coverageadwellingcoverage\">Coverage A - Dwelling Coverage</h2>\n<p>The dwelling coverage portion of a standard homeowners insurance policy pays to repair or rebuild your home’s physical structure, such as walls, floors, roof, windows, support beams, and foundation if your home is damaged by a covered event (fire, wind, theft, etc.).</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/other-structures.jpg\" alt=\"other-structures\" /></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"coveragebotherstructuresinsurance\">Coverage B - Other Structures Insurance</h2>\n<p>Home insurance also covers other structures on your property: your detached garage, fence, shed, and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/personal-property.jpg\" alt=\"personal-property\" /></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"coveragecpersonalpropertycoverage\">Coverage C - Personal Property Coverage</h2>\n<p>Personal property coverage protects your stuff—things like electronics, furniture, and clothing—anywhere in the world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/loss-of-use.jpg\" alt=\"loss-of-use\" /></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"coveragedlossofuseinsurance\">Coverage D - Loss of Use Insurance</h2>\n<p>If a covered claim makes your home uninhabitable, your Kin policy can help pay for extra living expenses, such as lodging, food costs, and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/personal-liability_191003_123411.jpg\" alt=\"personal-liability\" /></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"coverageepersonalliabilityinsurance\">Coverage E - Personal Liability Insurance</h2>\n<p>Even careful people get sued! Personal liability coverage can help pay for your legal expenses if you're held responsible for another person's injury or property loss.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\"><img src=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/medical-payments.jpg\" alt=\"medical-payments\" /></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"coveragefmedicalpaymentsinsurance\">Coverage F - Medical Payments Insurance</h2>\n<p>Medical payments coverage, which is part of your homeowners insurance, can help pay for your guests' immediate medical expenses if they're injured at your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoeshomeownersinsurancecover\">What Does Homeowners Insurance Cover?</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance covers your dwelling, personal property, and other structures from damage caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire / smoke damage</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">Hurricanes</a></li>\n<li>Hail</li>\n<li>Lightning</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Water damage from burst pipes and appliance flooding</li>\n<li>And more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The type of homeowners insurance policy you have determines how many events are covered. For example, we offer HO3 policies for most single-family homes. That’s because this kind of policy offers the robust protection – your home is covered for all perils except those the policy explicitly excludes. Learn more about <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">covered perils</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whathomeinsurancedoesntcover\">What Home Insurance Doesn't Cover</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance policies typically don’t cover damage or loss caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Earthquakes</li>\n<li>Flooding</li>\n<li>General wear and tear</li>\n<li>Negligence (or lack of regular and proper maintenance)</li>\n<li>Business liability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, you can always customize your Kin policy to get extra protection. For example, if you’re in Florida, you can add on <a href=\"/home-insurance/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> for as little as $174 a year. If you’re in California, we can add on earthquake insurance to better protect your home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatotherrisksdoeshomeownersinsurancecover\">What Other Risks Does Homeowners’ Insurance Cover?</h3>\n<p>Your home insurance quote covers far more than basic property claims for your dwelling. When you get a quote for home insurance, it includes other benefits that provide important protections for your and your family. For example, home insurance can cover:</p>\n<h4 id=\"personalliability\">Personal Liability</h4>\n<p>Most standard home insurance policies cover your personal liability. This means if someone outside of your household claims you’re responsible for their physical injury, your homeowner insurance company can help you cover the costs that follow – including legal expenses if the injured party decides to sue.</p>\n<p>Personal liability insurance can also cover some costs when it comes to property damage. For instance, let’s say your son kicks a ball through your neighbor’s picture window. Your homeowners' insurance protection most likely covers that claim, depending on the specifics of your policy.</p>\n<h4 id=\"guestsmedicalbills\">Guests’ Medical Bills</h4>\n<p>Your policy may also assist in paying medical bills for injuries sustained by people visiting your property, such as a friend, neighbor, or even a business contractor.</p>\n<p>The medical payments portion of your home insurance typically has strict rules about what it does and does not cover. And like other coverage parts, medical payments insurance has a maximum coverage amount, but we can help you figure out the appropriate coverage for the conditions of your home.</p>\n<h4 id=\"additionalexpenses\">Additional Expenses</h4>\n<p>Your home insurance company can sometimes cover your extra costs if you experience a covered claim that makes your home uninhabitable. For example, <a href=\"/blog/additional-living-expenses-examples/\">additional living expenses typically kick in</a> if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have to relocate due to a covered claim.</li>\n<li>Can’t use part of your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on your coverage, you can use the money you receive to help pay for the added cost of necessary items, like temporary housing.</p>\n<h4 id=\"damagetooutbuildings\">Damage to Outbuildings</h4>\n<p>Your homeowners insurance most likely comes with <a href=\"/blog/what-are-other-structures/\">coverage for other structures</a>, too. That usually includes buildings, like a detached garage, but “other structures” can also refer to items like fences and driveways. Having this coverage means you’re not stuck with the total bill if outbuildings or other structures on your property are damaged.</p>\n<h4 id=\"identitytheft\">Identity Theft</h4>\n<p>You can add <a href=\"/glossary/identity-fraud-insurance/\">identity fraud coverage</a> to your policy by opting for an <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a>. It covers expenses involved in repairing the damage as well as notary costs, lost wages, and legal fees.</p>\n<p>Please note that this endorsement adds coverage to your policy, and so it may change your original homeowners' insurance quote.</p>\n<h4 id=\"incidentsawayfromhome\">Incidents Away from Home</h4>\n<p>Here’s an interesting benefit of homeowners insurance: many policies can cover some incidents even when they occur away from your home. For instance, your insurance policy may kick in if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone breaks into your car. While your auto insurance policy covers damage to your car, it usually excludes your stolen personal property. Home insurance, however, can cover that.</li>\n<li>You caused an injury to another person while on vacation. Your personal liability goes with you as you move about the world, so many events are covered even if you're far from home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you’re looking for insurance on a home, you want to weigh all the coverages available in the policy. That way, you can tell if you’re getting the right kind of protection and services for your money when you get a home insurance quote.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeownersinsurancecoveragelevelsexplained\">Homeowners Insurance Coverage Levels Explained</h2>\n<p>Not all insurance policies are created equal. Your policy can pay for claims differently depending on the coverage level you choose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\"><strong>Actual cash value coverage</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This type of policy only pays the depreciated value of your home or lost belongings. In other words, it only pays for what they’re worth, not what you paid for them or what it really costs to replace them.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\"><strong>Replacement cost coverage</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This pays for what it actually costs to rebuild your home or replace your belongings at the current market rate. Unlike actual cash value, this doesn’t subtract depreciation from your claim payout.</li>\n<li><strong>Additional Coverage A.</strong> Also called guaranteed or extended replacement cost coverage, this is an inflation buffer in case building and repair costs soar when you need to make a claim. For example, with Kin, this offers more coverage than you purchased, extending your dwelling coverage limits by 25 percent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kin's HO3 policies offer replacement cost coverage for your dwelling. That’s because we want you to be able to bring your home back to its original glory when you need to. It’s one less thing to worry about when you’re dealing with a major loss. Actual cash value coverage is also available.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whoneedshomeownersinsurance\">Who Needs Homeowners Insurance?</h2>\n<p>All homeowners need home insurance. New homeowners need homeowners insurance in place to close on their house if they have a mortgage lender. And yes, you still need insurance even if you’ve paid off your mortgage (congratulations!).</p>\n<p>Why? Because losses are expensive.</p>\n<p>For example, a fire claim costs $68,322 on average. They are also the second <a href=\"/blog/most-common-home-insurance-claims/\">most common home insurance claim</a>. Total losses – instances where fires destroyed the whole home – are even costlier.</p>\n<p>It costs about $150 per square foot to build a home. So if you have a 1,500 square foot house, you could be looking at $225,000 in construction costs alone.</p>\n<p>Imagine paying that out of pocket!</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchhomeownersinsurancedoineed\">How Much Homeowners Insurance Do I Need?</h2>\n<p>How much home insurance you need depends on the replacement cost of your home. This is calculated roughly by the square footage of your home multiplied by building costs per square foot.</p>\n<p>For your belongings, other structures, and additional living expenses, the general rule is to have at least 20 percent of your dwelling insurance. So if your home is insured for $300,000, you’d want about $60,000 for each.</p>\n<p>If you have high-value belongings and fixtures, it might make sense to increase that coverage to 50 percent of your dwelling.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Choosing Your Coverage Limits</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Type of Coverage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dwelling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other Structures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Personal Property</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Loss of Use</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Personal Liability</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medical Payments</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"howarehomeownersinsuranceratesdetermined\">How Are Homeowners Insurance Rates Determined?</h2>\n<p>The biggest factor in how much home insurance costs is where you live. Your state, city, or even your neighborhood can indicate the likelihood of loss. The more claims an area has, the higher the insurance rates will usually be.</p>\n<p>For example, coastal communities in <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida</a> besieged with hurricanes or rural areas in <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California</a> suffering wildfires are becoming more and more expensive to insure. This is why <a href=\"/home-insurance/louisiana/\">Louisiana Home Insurance</a> is different from home insurance in Florida.</p>\n<p>Insurance companies have to price these policies to address the increased risk and the chance of paying a lot of claims at once.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that a home’s <a href=\"/faq/insurance-claims-history/\">claims stay on the record</a> for three to seven years, even if the claim came from a previous owner.</p>\n<p>But a lot of other factors can affect homeowners insurance premiums, too, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your home’s construction, roof type, and age.</li>\n<li>Your home’s heating, cooling, electrical, and plumbing.</li>\n<li>Attractive nuisances – a fun way to refer to trampolines or <a href=\"/blog/swimming-pool-insurance-requirements/\">swimming pools</a>, things known to tempt trespassers or cause injury.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductibles</a> you choose – the higher the deductible, the lower the premium.</li>\n<li>The coverage types and amounts you choose.</li>\n<li>Your home’s safety features – these can fetch you some <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">common home insurance discounts</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you apply for homeowners insurance, make sure to ask about available discounts. Our quotes are customizable, too, so you can see how your coverage types and amounts impact your premium in real-time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typesofhomeownersinsurancepolicies\">Types of Homeowners Insurance Policies</h2>\n<p>These are the <a href=\"/home-insurance/types-of-homeowners-insurance/\">different policy forms</a> insurance companies use to write home insurance policies. Learn what they mean for your coverage (spoiler: Kin offers HO-3 policies for single-family homes).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/ho1-policy/\"><strong>Basic Coverage (HO1 Policy)</strong></a> – This covers an owner-occupied standalone home against 10 named perils.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/ho2-policy/\"><strong>Broad Coverage (HO2 Policy)</strong></a> – This can cover the home against 16 named perils.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\"><strong>Special Coverage (HO3 Policy)</strong></a> – This is the most common type of homeowners insurance.
