That means you’re covered for hurricane damage, catastrophic ground cover collapse, and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">Flood insurance</a> and sinkhole insurance are both available as endorsements, but they are not part of your standard home insurance policy. If you’re eligible for coverage, you can add them simply by selecting the endorsements in our online application or asking your representative for help.</p>\n<h3 id=\"protectyourmostvaluableasset\">Protect your most valuable asset</h3>\n<p>Your home is likely the biggest purchase you will ever make. While home insurance can’t stop another catastrophic event like 2021’s Hurricane Ida from hitting Florida shores, it can help you recover. Home insurance from Kin can make it easier for you to repair or even rebuild when the worst-case scenario becomes reality.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defendyourdetachedstructures\">Defend your detached structures</h3>\n<p>Detached garages, fences, and sheds are just a few examples of outbuildings that you may have on your property.

But if you do, our home insurance may cover the costs that go beyond your normal living expenses, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Temporary accommodations.</li>\n<li>Increased food bills.</li>\n<li>Extra commuting costs.</li>\n<li>Necessary personal services like laundry or pet boarding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Home insurance can sometimes over these costs if civil authorities require you to evacuate for an event that is included in your policy.</p>\n<p>Do you lease your home or part of your home to renters? In that case, you may need a different type of coverage.

That said, our most recent data shows the average cost of Florida home insurance is <strong>$2,030 per year</strong> <em>–</em> and going up all the time. But our customers report saving over $700 on average when they switch to Kin.</p>\n<p>For an idea of how costs vary based on location, check out our guides below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/clearwater/\">Clearwater, Florida</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/daytona-beach/\">Daytona Beach, Florida</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/destin/\">Destin, Florida</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/gainesville/\">Gainesville, Florida</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/fort-lauderdale/\">Fort Lauderdale, Florida</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/fort-myers/\">Fort Myers, Florida</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/jacksonville/\">Jacksonville, Florida</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/miami/\">Miami, Florida</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/naples/\">Naples, Florida</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/orlando/\">Orlando, Florida</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/pensacola/\">Pensacola, Florida</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/sarasota/\">Sarasota, Florida</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/st-petersburg/\">St. Petersburg, Florida</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/tampa/\">Tampa, Florida</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/tallahassee/\">Tallahassee, Florida</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep in mind that the value of your home determines how much dwelling coverage you need, and that can have a major impact on your rates, too. To give you an idea of how that works, check out the chart below. It shows the average cost for home insurance in Florida for all insurers based on the amount of dwelling coverage required.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Coverage A Amount</th>\n<th>Average Florida Premium</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$49,999 and Under</td>\n<td>$1,218</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$50,000 to $74,999</td>\n<td>$1,187</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$75,000 to $99,999</td>\n<td>$1,039</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$100,000 to $124,000</td>\n<td>$1,209</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Other factors impact your insurance costs, too. While you can’t control some factors that impact price, like the location of your home or its age, you do have some options to reduce insurance costs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howtosavemoneyonyourfloridahomeinsurance\">How to save money on your Florida home insurance</h3>\n<p>Kin offers the following <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">home insurance discounts</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Home security discounts (think security and fire alarms)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">Wind mitigation discounts</a> (the more wind-proof your home, the better)</li>\n<li>Secured community discounts (if your community entrance has a guard, you’re in luck!)</li>\n<li>Water detection discounts (because no one wants a flooded basement)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/responsible-repair-discount/\">Responsible Repair Discoun</a>t (because you should be rewarded for not handing over your claims benefits)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/insurance-claims-history/\">Claims-free discount</a> (good job on keeping your home safe!)</li>\n<li>Electronic policy (save some paper and save some green)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And here are some ways to <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">save even more money on homeowners insurance</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Choose a higher deductible.</strong> This will lower your premium, but you will pay more out of pocket when you need to make a claim. Never take on a deductible you can’t comfortably afford.</li>\n<li><strong>Improve your credit score.</strong> This has a big impact on your rates. Simply paying your bills on time and not carrying a large balance on your credit cards can boost your score quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Shore up your home’s wind defenses.</strong> Florida requires home insurance companies to offer insurance discounts for homes that are hurricane resistant. Reinforcing your roof and installing impact-resistant windows can significantly reduce your insurance bill.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"ishomeownersinsurancerequiredinflorida\">Is homeowners insurance required in Florida?</h2>\n<p>Do you really need homeowners insurance in Florida? Yes. Though homeowners insurance isn’t required at the state level, nearly all mortgage providers require it. What’s more, if your home is in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) like most Florida homes, your lender will usually require you to have flood insurance, too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ishurricaneinsuranceincludedflhurricane\">Is hurricane insurance included? {#fl-hurricane}</h2>\n<p>Technically, there’s no such thing as <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a>, but your Kin policy does cover wind damage caused by hurricanes. It will also have a <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> that applies when you make a claim for losses caused by hurricane winds.</p>\n<p>Hurricane deductibles are usually available as the following dollar amounts and percentages of your policy’s dwelling insurance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$500</li>\n<li>1%</li>\n<li>2% (this is Kin’s default option)</li>\n<li>5%</li>\n<li>10%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if you have $300,000 in dwelling coverage and a 2% hurricane deductible, you’d be responsible for $6,000 toward a hurricane-wind loss.</p>\n<p>As for flood damage that typically accompanies hurricanes, your standard home insurance can’t cover that loss. Only flood insurance can do that. Kin can help homeowners find affordable flood insurance in Florida to protect their homes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whendohurricanedeductiblesapplyinflorida\">When do hurricane deductibles apply in Florida?</h3>\n<p>These deductibles apply when you experience property losses from hurricane winds. That means the loss must have occurred during a hurricane in the following timeframes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Starting when a hurricane watch or hurricane warning is issued for any portion of Florida by the <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">National Hurricane Center</a>.</li>\n<li>Remaining in effect for as long as hurricane conditions persist.</li>\n<li>Ending 72 hours after the end of the hurricane watch or warning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Insurance Information Institute estimates that <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/table-archive/220281\">2.8 million Florida homes</a> were at risk for storm surge damage from Category 5 hurricanes in 2020. The state’s <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/data/topics/people-society/population-and-demographics/our-changing-population/state/florida\">steady population growth</a> means that number has likely increased.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doesfloridahomeownersinsurancecoversinkholesflsinkholes\">Does Florida homeowners insurance cover sinkholes? {#fl-sinkholes}</h2>\n<p>Yes, to some degree – and that’s a good thing considering <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2015/0819/Massive-Florida-sinkhole-reopens.-Why-does-Sunshine-State-have-so-many\">6,500 Floridians</a> file sinkhole-related insurance claims each year.</p>\n<p>Florida law requires insurers to provide <a href=\"/glossary/catastrophic-ground-cover-collapse/\">catastrophic ground cover collapse coverage</a>, which can cover extreme sinkhole losses. For this coverage to kick in, all the following conditions must be met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There’s an “abrupt” collapse of ground cover</li>\n<li>The depression in the ground cover is clearly visible</li>\n<li>The home and its foundation sustain structural damage</li>\n<li>A government entity condemns the structure and orders it to be vacated</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/glossary/sinkhole-insurance/\">Sinkhole insurance</a> is a separate type of coverage not automatically included in a homeowners insurance policy. It offers more robust protection that applies to a variety of sinkhole losses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toprisksforfloridahomeownerstoprisks\">Top risks for Florida homeowners {#top-risks}</h2>\n<p>The risks your home faces depend on your location and your home’s characteristics. However, in Florida, the biggest risks most properties face are found in the chart below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"topperilsforfloridaproperties\">Top perils for Florida properties</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Risk</th>\n<th>Reason</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Wind Damage</td>\n<td>The average Florida wind damage claim is $11,000, but costs could increase depending on where you live and the severity of the storm.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Floods</td>\n<td>A study by the US Army Corps of Engineers puts the economic risk of storm surge at $9 billion.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sinkholes</td>\n<td>The cost of a sinkhole claim is $140,000, depending on the severity.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"insurancetipsforfloridahomeowners\">Insurance tips for Florida homeowners</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Think about the current state of your home and whether you have adequately protected it against the threat of hurricanes, floods, and more.</li>\n<li>If you already have a policy, review your coverage with us every year to make sure you qualify for every available discount.</li>\n<li>Check out our <a href=\"/claims/\">Claims Center</a> for insight into how we use technology to pay claims quickly and help you with repairs.</li>\n<li>Learn about <a href=\"/blog/florida-homestead-exemption/\">Florida Homestead Exemption</a>.</li>\n<li>Get a flood insurance policy, as water damage from storm surge is a notable exclusion from homeowners insurance in Florida.</li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"/blog/hurricane-clips/\">hurricane clips</a> and get a wind mitigation inspection.</li>\n<li>Be proactive about home maintenance and regularly check your plumbing and electrical systems throughout the year.</li>\n<li>Prepare a disaster supply kit in case you need to relocate temporarily at short notice.</li>\n<li>Ensure you have an evacuation plan should the worst happen.
